## User stories

AKA scenarios or user cases. Format: As a `type of user` I want to `action`, so that `benefit`.

Benefits:

- keeps the problem user-centered, actionable, and clear.

Mapping with 5W questions

- Diverse types of users (Who)
- User actions (What)
- User benefits (Why)

Advantages:

- Prioritize design goals
- Unite the team around a clear goal
- Inspire empathetic design decisions
- Personalize pitches to stakeholders

Terms:

- Happy path: A user story with the happy ending.
- Edge case: Rare situation or unexpected problem that interrupts a standard user experience.

Spotting & resolving edge cases:

- Create personas and user stories
- Thoroughly review the project before launch
- Use wireframes to visualize the project

## User journey (map)

The series of experiences a user has as they achieve a specific goal.

Series of stages, each with:

- Task list
- Feeling (adjectives)
- Improvement opportunities

Benefits:

- Helps UX designers create obstacle free paths
- Reduces impact of designer bias
- Highlights new pain points
- Identifies improvement opportunities

## Accessibility

**Accessibility** is the design of products, devices, services, or environments for people with disabilities.

Types:

- Permanent (e.g. no limb)
- Temporary (e.g. injured limb)
- Situational (e.g. holding something)


Additionally, accessibility is not just designing to include a group of users with varying abilities. Instead, it extends to anyone who is experiencing a permanent, temporary, or situational disability.
