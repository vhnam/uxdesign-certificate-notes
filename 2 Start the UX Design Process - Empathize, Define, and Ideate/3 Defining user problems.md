## Statements

These are all linked. You have a persona, what's their problem statement, what's the related hypothesis statement(s), how does a value proposition apply?

### Problem statements

> [Name of user persona] is a [type of user] who needs [type of user experience] because [benefits of user experience].

Covers the who, what, and why of the problem.

Characteristics:

- Human-centred
- Broad enough for creative freedom
- Narrow enough that it can be solved by a design solution

Benefits:

- Establish goals
- Understand constraints
- Define deliverables
- Create benchmarks for succeed

### Hypothesis statement

> Our best educated guess on what we think the solution to a design problem might be.

No fixed format, examples:

- If [action] then [outcome]
  - If user X downloads app, they can make a purchase.
- User X needs an app that does x, y, z.
- We believe x for y will z
  - We believe that a simplified checkout process for users on the move will allow them to purchase more easily.

### Value proposition

> The reason why a consumer should use a product or service

1. What does your product do? Clearly explain the offering that your product provides users.
2. Why should the user care? Describe how your product addresses usersâ€™ pain points.

## Human factor

> The range of variables humans bring to their product interactions

This claims that before WW2, people were moulded to fit the machine, instead of the inverse? Seems an unlikely anecdote.

## Psychological concepts

- Mental models: Internal maps that allow humans to predict how something will work.
- Feedback loops: The outcome the user gets at the end of a process. Give feedback on good / bad actions.
- Von Restorff effect / isolation effect: The one that differs from the rest will be remembered.
- Serial position effect: More likely to remember first few and last few.
- Hick's Law: More options the user has, longer to decide.
