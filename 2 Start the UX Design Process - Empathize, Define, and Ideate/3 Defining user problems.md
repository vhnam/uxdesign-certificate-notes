## Statements

These are all linked. You have a persona, what's their problem statement, what's the related hypothesis statement(s), how does a value proposition apply?

### Problem statements

> `[Name of user persona]` is a `[type of user]` who needs `[type of user experience]` because `[benefits of user experience]`.

Covers the who, what, and why of the problem.

5Wh questions for problem statements

- `Who` is experiencing the problem? Knowing your users and their background is key to creating successful solutions for them.
- `What` are the pain points you’re trying to solve? Determining a user’s pain points early allows you to answer the rest of these questions and clarify the context of the pain points.
- `Where` is the user when they’re using the product? A user’s physical context matters to your design.
- `When` does the problem occur? Maybe it’s right after the end of a long and tedious process, or maybe it’s something that happens daily. Knowing when the problem occurs can help you better empathize with the user’s feelings.
- `Why` is the problem important? Knowing how this problem affects your user’s experience and life will help to clarify the potential consequences.
- `How` are users reaching their goals by using the product? Understanding how users reach their goals allows you to map the user journey that they take through your product.

Characteristics:

- Human-centred
- Broad enough for creative freedom
- Narrow enough that it can be solved by a design solution

Benefits:

- Establish goals
- Understand constraints
- Define deliverables
- Create benchmarks for succeed

### Hypothesis statement

```md
If [user] can perform [action], then they will achieve [benefit].
```

Help designers move from defining problems toward ideating solutions

> Our best educated guess on what we think the solution to a design problem might be.

No fixed format, examples:

- If [action] then [outcome]
  - If user X downloads app, they can make a purchase.
- User X needs an app that does x, y, z.
- We believe x for y will z
  - We believe that a simplified checkout process for users on the move will allow them to purchase more easily.
- can use multiple hypothesis statements for one problem statement

### Value proposition

> The reason why a consumer should use a product or service

1. **What does your product do?** Clearly explain the offering that your product provides users.
2. **Why should the user care?** Describe how your product addresses users’ pain points.

Steps to create value propositions:

1. Describe your product’s features and benefits.
2. Explain the value of the product. Can be based on pain points
3. Connect these features and benefits with the needs of your users.
4. Review your official value proposition list.

## Human factor

> The human factor describes the range of variables humans bring to their product interactions

This claims that before WW2, people were moulded to fit the machine, instead of the inverse? Seems an unlikely anecdote.

Common human factors that inform design:

- impatience
- limited memory
- needing analogies
- limited concentration
- changes in need
- needing motivation
- prejudices
- fears
- making errors
- misjudgment

## Psychological concepts

- Mental models: Internal maps that allow humans to predict how something will work.
- Feedback loops: The outcome the user gets at the end of a process. Give feedback on good / bad actions.
- Von Restorff effect / isolation effect: The one that differs from the rest will be remembered.
- Serial position effect: More likely to remember first few and last few.
- Hick's Law: More options the user has, longer to decide.
