## Ideation

> the process of generating a broad set of ideas on a given topic with no attempt to judge or evaluate them.

Done _after_ empathizing with the user, and defining the problem.

### Process

- Brainstorm out loud
- Document all ideas
  - List of ideas is narrowed down when considering constraints, so gather lots first
  - Need to focus on ideas that work for many users, not just you
  - You might not be picking the best solution, users are!
- Focus on quantity without allowing evaluation
- Gather a diverse team
- Question the obvious
- Break, then evaluate the ideas

### Some tips for ideating effectively.

- Establish a creative environment
- Set a time limit.
- Assemble a diverse team
- Think outside the box.

### Idea picking

- Feasible: Technically possible to build?
- Desirable: Best at solving the user problem?
- Viable: Financially beneficial for the business?

### Business constraints

Branding includes voice, and tone.

## Goal statement

A product goal statement, which is one or two sentences that describe a product and its benefits for the user.

The ideal solution for the user:

- What the product lets users do
- Who the action affects
- Why the action positively affects users
- How the effectiveness of the product is measured

> Our [product] will let users [perform specific actions] which will affect [describe who the action will affect] by [describe how the action will positively affect them]. We will measure effectiveness by [describe how you will measure the impact].

A strong goal statement:

- Describes a **specific action** users can take or what the product will do.
- Defines **who** the action will affect.
- States **the positive impact** of the action or why the product solves the user's need.
- Outlines **success** in measurable terms.

Example transformation of problem statement to goal statement:

|          Problem statement          |        Goal statement         |
| :---------------------------------: | :---------------------------: |
| ![](/files/problem%20statement.png) | ![](/files/goalstatement.png) |

The following (verbatim) template can also be used:

> 1. Product: Start with your product. This could be an app, an object, or anything else.
> 2. Action: Describe the specific action your product enables users to perform.
> 3. Audience: Describe who the action will primarily affect. This could be the user themselves.
> 4. Impact: Describe how the action will positively affect that person.
> 5. Criteria: Describe how you’ll measure the action’s effectiveness.

## Competitive audit

A competitive audit is an overview of your competitors' strengths and weaknesses. We know that it's important to come up with lots of ideas before deciding on one solution.

What can you learn:

- Identify key competitors
- Review products competitors offer
- Understand how competitors position themselves in the market
- Examine what competitors do well, and could do better
- How do competitors talk about themselves

Who is competition:

- Direct competitors: Similar products, same audience
- Indirect competitors: Only one is the same, so overlap. For example, same industry.

Benefits:

- Inform your design process (what presumably works?)
- Solve usability problems
- Reveal market gaps
- Provide reliable evidence(?)
- Save time, money, and energy

Limitations:

- Can stifle creativity (just copying)
- Depends a lot on interpretation of findings
- Not all designs / ideas work for everyone!
- Should be done regularly

How to conduct:

1. Outline goals: Specific, what product aspect to compare, etc.
2. Create spreadsheet of competitors: 5-10, some direct, some indirect.
3. Call out specific aspects being compared.
   - e.g. first impressions, interaction, visual design, content
4. Research each company: What works well, their audience, etc.
   - e.g. audience
5. Analyze findings: Trends, themes, similarities.
6. Summarize findings in a report.

How to present summary:

- Get feedback from your team.
- Stick to the highlights.
- Use notes.
- Practice ahead of time.
- Use relevant graphics.
- Keep your biases in check.
- Be able to defend your conclusions.

### Competitive audit report

- **What are your audit goals?** The designer imports their audit goals verbatim from their audit template spreadsheet.
- **Who are your key competitors?** The designer describes each competitor in 1–2 sentences, including whether they are direct or indirect competitors.
- **What are the type and quality of the competitors’ products?** The designer describes what each competitor offers, making note of what they do well and what they could do better. Importantly, the designers’ answers here are both complete and relatively brief: no more than a short paragraph (2–5 sentences) for each competitor.
- **How do the competitors position themselves in the market?** The designer describes each competitor’s target audience in a few sentences, including the characteristics of their ideal customers (age, location, income, spending habits, and so on).
- **How do the competitors talk about themselves?** The designer includes each competitors’ unique value proposition. They summarize what each competitor claims about its offerings in 2–3 sentences.
- **What are the competitors’ strengths?** The designer briefly lists 2–4 things each competitor does particularly well.
- **What are the competitors’ weaknesses?** The designer briefly lists 2–4 things each competitor could do better.
- **What gaps are there in the competitors’ products?** The designer briefly identifies 2–3 gaps in the market that the competitors do not fill. This category can include design or product features, customization options, accessibility elements, and so on.
- **What opportunities are there for your product to stand out?** The designer lists 2–3 opportunities for their product to stand out from its competitors.

### Delivering a strong presentation

- **Get feedback from your team.** Share your report or slides with a trusted teammate ahead of time to get their take on how the information flows.
- **Limit the amount of text on your slides.** Your slides should include just enough information to draw attention to important points. Save the details for your speech.
- **Stick to the highlights.** A presentation to your team or client should only focus on the highlights of your audit. If you want to get into more detail, add them to the appendix of your presentation or create a written report.
- **Use notes.** An outline or note cards can help you stay focused, on topic, and on time.
- **Practice ahead of time.** Do a few trial runs before the big day to get comfortable with the content and pace of your presentation.
- **Use relevant graphics.** Make sure any images and graphics relate directly to the topic of your presentation. Choose images and graphics carefully to ensure they enhance clarity.
- **Keep your biases in check.** Be aware of your own design biases and try to prevent them from clouding your judgment during the presentation.
- **Be able to defend your conclusions.** Make sure you have evidence to back up your conclusions. Use actual data and specific examples whenever possible.

## "How Might We" for ideation

- How: Explore a bunch of ideas
- Might: Emphasis this is only possible solutions
- We: Collaborative effort

Ways to create HMW phrases:

- "Amp up the good": Think of how you might use any positives in the problem as a solution.
- "Explore the opposite": Think of how you’d solve the opposite of the problem you’ve outlined.
- "Change a status quo": Think of ways to completely change the process.
- "Break the point-of-view into pieces": This is especially helpful for long, complex problems.
- "Remove the bad": Think of how to remove the negative part of the problem entirely.
- "Go after the adjective": Take any negative adjectives and try to turn them into positives.
- "Question an assumption": Remove or change any processes that you assume have to be in place.
- "Create an analogy using the established need or context": Think of ways to compare this user experience to another experience.
- "Identify unexpected resourced that can provide assistance": Think of how the problem might be solved by a resource that isn’t mentioned in the problem statement.

Should be specific in describing needs, but still have space for innovation.

## Rapid Sketching

### Best practices

- Do a creative warm-up exercise
- Make sure your problem is well defined.
- Don’t judge your ideas.
- Don’t judge other people’s ideas.
- Include a diverse group.
- Ideate in a comfortable environment.
- Don’t be afraid of sketching.

### Benefits

- generates a lot of ideas in a small amount of time
- forces you to think outside the box because you have to come up with many ideas in a short timeframe, without judging them.

### Best practices for thinking of HMWs

- **Be broad**. A good HMW should allow for multiple solutions.
- **But don’t be too broad.** You want your HMWs to be comprehensive, but narrow enough to keep your solutions focused.
- **Make multiple drafts.** It’s okay to change your HMW questions after you’ve written them. If you find that your HMW doesn’t help you think of any useful solutions, change it up!
- **Be creative.** HMWs are meant to be imaginative and even fun.
- **Write as many HMWs as you can.** The more HMWs you have, the more solutions you can come up with.

## Reminder

Verbatim, from earlier content:

> Empathy maps explore users’ four main motivations: what the user says, thinks, does, and feels. The insights gathered from empathy maps help you come up with ideas for solutions that address users’ real problems.
>
> Personas place the users who you’re designing for front and center. By creating detailed user profiles, you can clearly envision potential users that you’d design for.
>
> User stories determine which user needs are the most critical to address with your designs. This direction will help focus your ideation.
>
> User journeys help you come up with ideas for designs that truly support the users’ needs and solve their problems.
>
> A problem statement is a clear description of the user’s need that should be addressed. The problem statement you created in the last course will guide the focus of your ideation.

A new host just... appeared, without any mention? Additionally, she changed appearance drastically (makeup, hair, outfit) between videos!

A very dense module!
