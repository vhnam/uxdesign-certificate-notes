## Ideation

> the process of generating a broad set of ideas on a given topic with no attempt to judge or evaluate them.

Done _after_ empathising with the user, and defining the problem.

### Process

- Brainstorm out loud
- Document all ideas
  - List of ideas is narrowed down when considering constraints, so gather lots first
  - Need to focus on ideas that work for many users, not just you
  - You might not be picking the best solution, users are!
- Focus on quantity
- Do not allow evaluation
- Gather a diverse team
- Question the obvious
- Break, then evaluate the ideas

### Idea picking

- Feasible: Technically possible to build?
- Desirable: Best at solving the user problem?
- Viable: Financially beneficial for the business?

### Business constraints

Branding includes voice, and tone.

## Goal statement

The ideal solution for the user:

- What the product lets users do
- Who the action affects
- Why the action positively affects users
- How the effectiveness of the product is measured

> Our [product] will let users [perform specific actions] which will affect [describe who the action will affect] by [describe how the action will positively affect them]. We will measure effectiveness by [describe how you will measure the impact].

Example transformation of problem statement to goal statement:

|          Problem statement          |        Goal statement         |
| :---------------------------------: | :---------------------------: |
| ![](/files/problem%20statement.png) | ![](/files/goalstatement.png) |

The following (verbatim) template can also be used:

> 1. Product: Start with your product. This could be an app, an object, or anything else.
> 2. Action: Describe the specific action your product enables users to perform.
> 3. Audience: Describe who the action will primarily affect. This could be the user themselves.
> 4. Impact: Describe how the action will positively affect that person.
> 5. Criteria: Describe how you’ll measure the action’s effectiveness.

## Competitive audit

What can you learn:

- Identify key competitors
- Review products competitors offer
- Understand how competitors position themselves in the market
- Examine what competitors do well, and could do better
- How do competitors talk about themselves

Who is competition:

- Direct competitors: Similar products, same audience
- Indirect competitors: Only one is the same, so overlap. For example, same industry.

Benefits:

- Inform your design process (what presumably works?)
- Solve usability problems
- Reveal market gaps
- Provide reliable evidence(?)

Limitations:

- Can stifle creativity (just copying)
- Depends a lot on interpretation of findings
- Not all designs / ideas work for everyone!
- Should be done regularly

How to conduct:

1. Outline goals: Specific, what product aspect to compare, etc.
2. Create spreadsheet of competitors: 5-10, some direct, some indirect.
3. Call out specific aspects being compared.
   - e.g. first impressions, interaction, visual design, content
4. Research each company: What works well, their audience, etc.
   - e.g. audience
5. Analyze findings: Trends, themes, similarities.
6. Summarise findings in a report.

How to present summary:

- Get feedback from your team.
- Stick to the highlights.
- Use notes.
- Practice ahead of time.
- Use relevant graphics.
- Keep your biases in check.
- Be able to defend your conclusions.

## "How Might We" for ideation

- How: Explore a bunch of ideas
- Might: Emphasis this is only possible solutions
- We: Collaborative effort

Ways to create HMW phrases:

- "Amp up the good": Think of how you might use any positives in the problem as a solution.
- "Explore the opposite": Think of how you’d solve the opposite of the problem you’ve outlined.
- "Change a status quo": Think of ways to completely change the process.
- "Break the point-of-view into pieces": This is especially helpful for long, complex problems.
- "Remove the bad": Think of how to remove the negative part of the problem entirely.
- "Go after the adjective": Take any negative adjectives and try to turn them into positives.
- "Question an assumption": Remove or change any processes that you assume have to be in place.
- "Create an analogy using the established need or context": Think of ways to compare this user experience to another experience.
- "Identify unexpected resourced that can provide assistance": Think of how the problem might be solved by a resource that isn’t mentioned in the problem statement.

Should be specific in describing needs, but still have space for innovation.

## Reminder

Verbatim, from earlier content:

> Empathy maps explore users’ four main motivations: what the user says, thinks, does, and feels. The insights gathered from empathy maps help you come up with ideas for solutions that address users’ real problems.
>
> Personas place the users who you’re designing for front and center. By creating detailed user profiles, you can clearly envision potential users that you’d design for.
>
> User stories determine which user needs are the most critical to address with your designs. This direction will help focus your ideation.
>
> User journeys help you come up with ideas for designs that truly support the users’ needs and solve their problems.
>
> A problem statement is a clear description of the user’s need that should be addressed. The problem statement you created in the last course will guide the focus of your ideation.

## Feedback

A new host just... appeared, without any mention? Additionally, she changed appearance drastically (makeup, hair, outfit) between videos!

A very dense module!
