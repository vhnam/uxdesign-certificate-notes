  - Creativity (sketches, prototypes)
  - Iteration (feedback and refinements)

- The final outcome: a **professional UX portfolio** that showcases your **end-to-end design thinking** and **impact-driven problem solving**.

## 🎨 UX Research, Usability Testing, and Final Portfolio Preparation

### 🧾 Creating a UX Research Plan

Before conducting a **usability study**, you must create a **research plan** — the foundation for your study that ensures meaningful, actionable results.

#### **7 Elements of a UX Research Plan**

1. **Project Background:**

   - Explain why this research is needed and what context led to it.

2. **Research Goals:**

   - Define what you’re trying to solve or learn through the study.

3. **Research Questions:**

   - List specific, actionable questions to guide the study (not participant interview questions).

4. **Key Performance Indicators (KPIs):**

   - Identify measurable signs of success or progress (e.g., task completion rate, error frequency).

5. **Methodology:**

   - Describe how you’ll collect and analyze your data.

6. **Participants:**

   - Identify your target participants — ideally members of the community you’re designing for (especially in social good projects).

7. **Script / Discussion Guide:**

   - Prepare the exact prompts or questions you’ll use during the study.

### 🧍‍♀️ Conducting a Usability Study

#### **Purpose:**

Evaluate how easy it is for users to complete tasks in your design and gather insights for improvement.

#### **Types:**

- **Moderated:** Researcher guides and interacts with participants in real time.
- **Unmoderated:** Participants complete tasks independently, often with screen recording.

#### **Guidelines:**

- 5–8 participants are sufficient for meaningful insights.
- Collect both quantitative data (task success) and qualitative feedback (frustrations, emotions).
- Iterate early — it’s cheaper and easier to fix low-fidelity designs.

### 🔍 Analyzing & Synthesizing Research Results

#### **Four Steps to Generate Insights:**

1. **Gather data:**

   - Combine all notes, sticky observations, and feedback in one place.
