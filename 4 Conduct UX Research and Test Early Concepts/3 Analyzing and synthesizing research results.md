## From observations to insights

- Gather the data in one place
- Organize the data (Synthesis means combining ideas to draw conclusions by grouping feedback into common themes)
- Find themes -> This process helps evolve the understanding of user needs.
- Come up with insights -> These insights guide the iteration process, where designers revise and improve their original ideas.

The goal is continuous improvement based on user feedback

### Turning UX Research Observations into Actionable Insights

- After planning and conducting a UX research study, the next step is to extract **actionable insights** from observations.
- An insight is an observation that reveals something new about users or their needs.
- Insights explain how data connects, what it means, and what actions to take.

### 4 Steps to Develop Insights:

1. Gather the Data

- Collect all research data in one place (e.g., sticky notes, spreadsheets, audio notes, notebooks).
- Include notes from all observers.

2. Organize the Data

- Arrange the collected data.
- Use methods like **affinity diagramming** or spreadsheets to start structuring information.

3. Find Themes

- Identify recurring themes or patterns across participants.
- Themes are essential for translating data into insights.

4. Write Insights

- For each theme, write an insight that guides the design team on how to improve the product.
- Expect to generate a few solid themes and insights based on the volume of data.

This process is part of synthesis—combining ideas to draw conclusions.

## Steps 1 & 2: Gather and Organize Data Using Affinity Diagramming

### Gather the Data

- Collect all participant observations in one place.
- If notes were taken on sticky notes, gather all of them.
- If using spreadsheets or paper, transfer each observation onto individual sticky notes.

### Organize the Data (Affinity Diagramming)

- Affinity diagramming is a method for organizing related observations into clusters or themes.
- Each sticky note should contain one observation.
- Place sticky notes on a wall, window, or whiteboard.
- Compare notes one by one and group related ideas together (like sorting books by genre).
- Aim for 4–5 clusters, but adjust as needed.
- Revisit clusters to refine groupings; not all notes will fit a cluster—set those aside.

### Benefits of Affinity Diagramming

- Helps identify common themes across observations.
- Easy to move and rearrange ideas visually.
- Adaptable for participants with visual impairments by using verbal instructions and group feedback.

### Creating an Affinity Diagram

Affinity diagramming helps organize usability study data into meaningful groups based on common themes or relationships. It reveals patterns and supports better design decisions.

#### Step-by-Step Process:

1. Find a Workspace

- Use a large surface (whiteboard, wall, window) for placing sticky notes.

2. Create Sticky Notes

- Write each individual observation, idea, or quote on its own sticky note.
- Keep each note brief and specific (e.g., “Hard to read text on homepage”).
- Use quotation marks for direct quotes from participants.

3. Group Sticky Notes

- Cluster related notes into groups as you review them.
- You can pre-label some groups (e.g., “Scheduling”) or create group names as patterns emerge.
- Example groups for a dog walker app:
  - Scheduling
  - Dog Walker Selection
  - Booking + Checkout

4. Sort All Notes

- Continue grouping until all sticky notes are reviewed.
- Aim for 3 to 10 groups.
- If a note doesn’t fit any group, decide whether to:
  - Create a new group
  - Set it aside for further consideration

5. Second Review

- Revisit groupings to:
  - Move notes if needed
  - Rename or combine groups
  - Create sub-groups for large clusters

#### Tips & Benefits:

- Affinity diagramming is flexible—no right or wrong way to group.
- Encourages team collaboration and creative thinking.
- Helps identify problems, patterns, and potential solutions.
- Makes complex research data easier to understand and act on.
- Supports inclusive collaboration (can be adapted for visual impairments).

### Step 3: Finding Themes in Usability Data

Identify **patterns** in research data and turn them into **themes** that reveal user needs and design issues.

#### Steps to Identify Themes:

1. Start with the Affinity Diagram

- Look for groupings of 3–5 sticky notes (especially when working with small sample sizes like 5 participants).
- Grouped sticky notes typically indicate a pattern.

2. Examples from Dog Walker App:

- Pattern 1: Multiple notes about booking recurring dog walkers →
  Theme: Most participants want the ability to make recurring bookings.

- Pattern 2: Four users were frustrated by the lack of a confirmation page →
  Theme: Most participants want to confirm details before completing a booking.

3. How to Write Themes:

- Expand on the pattern by connecting it to the user's experience.
- Think about what the pattern tells you about the product design.

#### Key Takeaways:

- Patterns = repeated feedback.
- Themes = what those patterns reveal about user expectations and needs.
- Affinity diagrams make theme identification faster and clearer.

## Strong insights

### What Makes an Insight Strong?

1. Grounded in Real Data

- Based only on observed behaviors—not assumptions or feelings.
- Backed by multiple participant data points (not just one outlier).

2. Answers Research Questions

- Each insight should tie back to the research questions defined in your plan.
- Helps demonstrate why the insight matters.

3. Clear and Easy to Understand

- Use simple, jargon-free language.
- Anyone—even those unfamiliar with the study—should be able to understand it.

4. Builds Empathy for Users

- Helps the team connect emotionally with user frustrations or needs.
- Empathy boosts engagement and motivation to improve the design.

5. Inspires Action

- Should point toward a design improvement or decision.
- Vague insights (e.g., “The app is useful”) aren’t helpful—be specific.

### Key Takeaway:

Strong insights are data-driven, relevant, clear, empathetic, and actionable. Use these principles at any stage of the UX design process.
