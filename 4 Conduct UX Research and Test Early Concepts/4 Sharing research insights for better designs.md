## How to Share UX Research Insights

You share and promote your insights with stakeholders using two common formats:

1. Presentations

- A slide deck that provides a high-level overview.
- Typically includes 15-20 slides divided into sections like study details, themes, insights, recommendations, and appendix.
- Focuses on top 3-5 key insights to keep stakeholders engaged.
- Great for sharing with large or mixed audiences, including non-UX professionals.
- Created using tools like Google Slides, PowerPoint, or Keynote.

- Appendix

2. Research Reports

- A more detailed document with fewer visuals but similar content.
- Usually places summaries and recommendations upfront for quick reading.
- Created using tools like Google Docs, Word, or Pages.

Both formats effectively communicate research findings—next, you’ll learn how to build a strong presentation.

### Tips for Creating a Strong Presentation

1. Know Your Audience

- Tailor your presentation to the interests and background of your audience (e.g., marketing vs. management) to keep them engaged and gain support.

2. Provide an Overview

- Start with a roadmap or table of contents so the audience knows what to expect. Include an executive summary to share key takeaways and how the research impacts big-picture goals.

3. Tell a Story

- Structure your presentation like a story with a clear beginning, middle, and end. Use real user examples—quotes, photos, or videos—to make insights more relatable and emotional.

4. Show Data

- Use charts and graphs to clearly communicate important insights and support your story visually.

5. Less Is More with Text

- Keep slides concise with minimal text focusing on high-level points. Avoid overwhelming your audience with too much reading.

6. Provide Recommendations for Next Steps

- End with clear, actionable recommendations to guide product changes, further research, or meetings, helping gain stakeholder buy-in.

7. Leave Time for Questions

- Allow time at the end for questions and clarifications to engage your audience and address their interests.

### To create and deliver a presentation

The text covers how to organize and share research insights effectively, focusing on creating and delivering a presentation. Research insights should be data-driven, clear, empathetic, and actionable.

#### Part 1: Slide Presentation

- Presentations tell a story with a clear beginning, middle, and end.
- Use a template for structure, including:

  - Title slide (topic, date, contributors)
  - Table of contents
  - Project background (why the research was done)
  - Study details (research questions, participants, methodology, prototype screenshots with alt text)
  - Research themes (one theme per slide, supported by data and participant quotes)
  - Insights (3–5 key findings, stated simply)
  - Recommendations (at least three actionable steps based on insights)

- Add visuals and accessibility features like alt text.
- Keep slides informative, usable, and engaging.

#### Part 2: Planning and Presenting

- Use speaker notes as brief prompts, not scripts, to maintain a natural tone.
- Practice presenting aloud to improve flow, tone, inclusivity, and confidence.
- Consider recording and reviewing your presentation to refine delivery.
- Key presentation tips: be concise, conversational, use stories, pause appropriately, and make eye contact.

#### Key Takeaways

The elements in the presentation include the:

- Template
- Introduction slide
- Project background
- Study details
- Research themes
- Insights
- Recommendations

A strong research presentation tells the full story of the study—why it was done, how it was conducted, what was found, and what should be done next. Preparation, practice, and using presentation tools like notes and recording help ensure a confident and engaging delivery.

### The presentation delivery tips

- **Be concise** – Focus on the main points and avoid rambling or unnecessary details.
- **Keep your tone conversational** – Speak naturally, like chatting with a friend, not reading a script.
- **Use stories** – Engage your audience with relatable, specific examples that illustrate your points.
- **Master the pause** – Don’t rush to fill silence; pauses show confidence and help the audience absorb information.
- **Make eye contact** – Connect with your audience by looking at different individuals throughout your presentation.

Remember, presenting is a skill you develop with practice, and using these tips will help you become more engaging and confident.

### Tips for overcoming stage fright when presenting:

- **Prepare thoroughly**: Know your content and practice multiple times to build comfort.
- **Think positively**: Visualize success instead of worrying about mistakes.
- **Try power poses**: Use confident postures (like the Wonder Woman pose) to boost confidence.
- **Breathe deeply**: Take steady breaths to reduce anxiety and stay calm.
- **Get good sleep**: Rest well to have a clear mind and better focus.
- **Remember your goal**: The audience wants the information, not perfection.
- **Accept mistakes**: Small stumbles or pauses are normal and understandable—stay relaxed.

With practice and confidence, you can overcome stage fright and become a great presenter.

### Tips for giving an effective presentation

- **Speak clearly and slowly** to ensure understanding; use a steady rhythm to pace yourself.
- **Use pauses confidently**, especially when asking questions or transitioning sections, to control pacing.
- **Make eye contact** with individuals for 3–5 seconds to connect, or look near their eyes if direct contact feels uncomfortable. For virtual presentations, look at the camera.
- **Be concise** — stick to valuable points, and hook your audience quickly since attention spans are short. Use storytelling to engage.
- **Show confident body language**: move naturally, smile, nod, and avoid closed-off gestures. Virtually, use expressive facial and hand gestures.
- **Know your audience** and tailor tone and content accordingly; be genuine to build trust.

### Handling questions:

- Know your material well and prepare for tough questions.
- Use storytelling to reinforce insights.
- Repeat questions for clarity.
- Stay professional and avoid defensiveness.
- Keep answers concise to allow multiple questions.
- Take your time to respond thoughtfully when needed.

Confidence comes from preparation, clear speech, and engaging storytelling—practice to improve!

## Modify low-fidelity designs based on insights

- After sharing research insights with stakeholders and deciding what to act on, the next step is to use those insights to improve your designs.
- Usability studies reveal pain points in prototypes; fixing these improves the user experience before launch.
- Prioritize insights by urgency with your team:

  - Priority 0 (P0): Critical issues that must be fixed (e.g., preventing users from completing key tasks, deceptive patterns, or accessibility problems).
  - Priority 1 (P1): Important but not critical; improvements that enhance experience but don’t block main flows.
  - Priority 2 (P2): Lower priority fixes, often scheduled for later iterations.

- Prioritization helps teams focus on the most important changes first.
- Usability studies typically involve 5-8 participants to gather valuable feedback without diminishing returns.
- UX design is an iterative process: research, synthesize insights, revise designs, and repeat—especially focusing on underrepresented user groups.
- The process is cyclical rather than strictly linear, with continuous improvement through multiple iterations.

## How to make research-based design changes

Updates are made to wireframes in Figma based on prioritized insights from the usability study, not directly to the low-fidelity prototype.

Wireframes are like the pages of a book that get edited before binding into a final product (the prototype).

For the dog walker app, three key changes were implemented:

1. Added an option for recurring dog walking appointments via a checkbox below date and time fields.
2. Replaced the open text box for date selection with a scrollable list of dates and times; also added the ability to specify walk duration.
3. Introduced a new confirmation page before finalizing the booking to give users a review step.

After updating wireframes, the next step is to reconnect screens in Figma to recreate the low-fidelity prototype for further testing or stakeholder feedback.
