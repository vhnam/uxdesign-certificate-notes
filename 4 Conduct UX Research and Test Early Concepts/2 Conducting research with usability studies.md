Usability studies are a research method that assesses how easy it is for participants to complete core tasks in a design.

The second step in UX research is `conducting a usability study`, which evaluates how easily users can complete tasks in a design. These studies help design teams identify improvements based on real user interactions and feedback. Usability studies can be conducted at various stages—during early `concept testing` (often is lo-fi prototype), with interactive prototypes, or even after a product is launched.

Researchers observe participants using the product and may also interview them afterward to gather deeper insights. A small group of around `five participants` is typically sufficient to uncover major usability issues while keeping costs low.

Usability studies offer a low-risk, high-reward way to test and refine designs. While feedback may include critiques, it ultimately leads to a better user experience. Next, the two types of usability studies—`moderated and unmoderated`—will be explored.

## Moderated vs unmoderated

There are two main types of usability studies: moderated and unmoderated.

- `Moderated` usability studies involve a moderator guiding participants in real time, asking follow-up questions, clarifying tasks, and building rapport. These studies provide in-depth insights but may introduce bias, are harder to schedule, and may limit participant comfort if there's a mismatch with the moderator.
- `Unmoderated` usability studies are conducted without a moderator. Participants complete tasks independently, offering flexibility, real-world usage insights, and greater comfort with sensitive topics. However, there's no real-time support or follow-up, and the UX team has less control over the participant’s environment and attention.

Each method has benefits and limitations. The choice between them depends on the study's **goals**, **scope**, and **participant needs**.

Regardless of whether a usability study is moderated or unmoderated, some key elements remain consistent:

- `Tasks` should reflect real user actions, such as placing an order or entering information.
- `Scripts` must be repeated consistently with each participant to ensure uniformity.
- `Participants` should represent the product’s target users and align with established user personas.
- `Usability studies` can be conducted at any stage of the design process—whether using a low-fidelity prototype, high-fidelity prototype, or a finished product—depending on the project’s goals, timeline, and budget.

## Explore usability study best practices

### Before the study begins

Key steps include:

- **Build rapport** by starting with casual conversation to make participants feel comfortable.
- **Express gratitude** for their time, both verbally and with small gestures like thank-you gifts.
- **Encourage honesty**, assuring participants that feedback won’t offend the team and is crucial for improvement.
- **Handle paperwork**, like NDAs, in a friendly, transparent way to build trust—especially important for marginalized or at-risk groups.
- **Explain the study** by outlining what to expect and checking if the participant is comfortable moving forward.
- **Set ground rules**, such as using the think-aloud method, and emphasize that participants are not being tested—any difficulty reflects on the design, not them.
- **Maintain emotional neutrality** to avoid influencing participant responses and ensure unbiased results.

The goal is to center the **participant's experience** throughout the process.

### During the study

During the usability tasks in a moderated usability study, effective communication with participants is essential. The moderator’s goal is to understand the participant’s experience without influencing it.

Key moderation techniques include:

- **Ask open-ended questions** to encourage detailed feedback (e.g., “How do you think that went?”).
- **Use follow-up questions** like “Can you tell me more about that?” to clarify participant responses and avoid assumptions.
- **Summarize for confirmation** only if you're still unclear after open-ended and follow-up questions—this helps ensure accuracy without leading the participant.

Moderators should also be mindful of personal biases, as participants will come from diverse backgrounds. Up next, the focus will be on recognizing and managing bias during usability studies.

### Five best practices

A diverse group of participants leads to more valuable usability study feedback, as their varied experiences and abilities highlight different user needs. To conduct an effective study, follow these five best practices.

These practices help ensure inclusive, user-centered design.

#### Get comfortable

To gather valuable feedback in a usability study, participants need to feel **comfortable and at ease** with the moderator. Begin with light, tailored small talk to build **professional-but-friendly rapport** and encourage openness. Always **thank participants** for their time and remind them that **honest, constructive feedback** is essential for improving the design.

Ensure the **study environment is comfortable**, whether it’s a lab, home, public space, or online. Each setting requires different preparations to minimize distractions and accommodate participants. In remote studies, clearly communicate what will be recorded and how the recordings will be used.

#### Put people first

In a usability study, it’s essential to **respect participants’ identities** by using their preferred pronouns, correct name pronunciation, courtesy titles, and communication preferences. This shows respect and keeps the focus on how real people interact with technology.

When working with **interpreters**, always address the participant directly. Use **people-first language** (e.g., “person with a disability”) to show empathy and respect for diverse backgrounds and abilities.

Marginalized communities are often overlooked in research, leading to designs that don't meet their needs. Actively **include diverse participants**, especially from marginalized groups, to uncover new insights and create more inclusive, effective products.

#### Don’t skip the paperwork

After making participants comfortable, have them complete paperwork like a nondisclosure agreement (NDA) to protect confidentiality and intellectual property. For minors, parental consent is required. Participants must also consent to session recordings, which help with later analysis. Proper paperwork builds trust and ensures ethical research practices.

#### Communicate clearly

Before starting the study, explain its focus and provide a clear roadmap, confirming the participant is comfortable with it. Introduce the think-aloud method, where participants verbalize their thoughts while completing tasks, helping you understand their experience. Emphasize that participants aren’t being tested and there are no right or wrong answers—the goal is to evaluate the design’s usability. If feedback is unclear, summarize and confirm with the participant to ensure understanding.

#### Ask the right questions

The questions you ask in usability studies shape the insights you gain. Use the same set of questions with each participant for consistency. Ask open-ended questions—especially “why” questions—to encourage detailed feedback. Prompt participants to elaborate with follow-ups like “tell me more about that.” Ask key questions from different angles to get deeper or clearer responses. Avoid mentioning other participants to protect privacy and prevent bias. Also, steer clear of leading questions that might influence participants’ answers; keep questions neutral and open-ended.

## Identify biases when interviewing usability study participants

**Bias is unconscious** and affects everyone. Being aware of it helps minimize its impact.

Moderator Biases:

- Confirmation Bias: Tendency to seek evidence that confirms pre-existing beliefs.
- Leading Questions: Questions that steer participants toward specific answers.
- Implicit Bias: Unconscious stereotypes that can affect expectations and participant recruitment.
- Serial Position Effect: Tendency to remember the first and last items in a sequence more than the middle ones.

Participant Biases:

- Serial Position Effect: Participants also better remember the first and last instructions.
- Friendliness Bias: Participants may agree with the moderator to avoid conflict, leading to less honest feedback.
- Social Desirability Bias: Participants may give answers they think are socially acceptable rather than truthful.
- Hawthorne Effect: Participants change behavior when they know they’re being observed.

Tips:

- Build rapport carefully to avoid overly friendly dynamics.
- Remind participants that honest feedback is critical.
- Use neutral phrasing and third-party statements to reduce social pressure.

Understanding and reducing bias leads to **more accurate and actionable research** — helping design better, more inclusive user experiences.

### Strategies to Reduce Moderator Bias

Reducing bias is a **continuous process** that takes practice and self-awareness. These strategies help ensure usability studies collect **honest, unbiased user feedback**.

1. Identify and Acknowledge Your Own Biases

- Recognizing personal assumptions is the first step toward objectivity.
- Example exercise: Reflect on your assumptions about who uses handbags to uncover unconscious bias.

2. Allow for Diverse Responses

- Phrase questions to invite a variety of answers.
- Avoid making assumptions or leading participants toward specific responses.

3. Recruit a Representative Sample

- Include participants that reflect your key user base and underrepresented groups to ensure inclusive feedback.

4. Define Research Criteria in Advance

- Set clear goals and questions ahead of time with your team to reduce influence from personal opinions.

5. Use Open-Ended, Neutral Questions

- Ask things like "How did it go?" or "What worked and what didn’t?" instead of yes/no or leading questions.

6. Let Participants Speak Freely

- Encourage full expression and ask follow-ups to clarify their true thoughts and feelings.

7. Watch Your Body Language

- Friendly gestures (smiling, nodding) can influence participants to give more agreeable or pleasing responses.

## Notetaking in Usability Studies

Notetaking helps capture rich, detailed insights that recordings alone might miss, making it a critical part of the usability study process.

### Why Take Notes?

- Capture observations: Document nonverbal cues like body language or tone, while being mindful of bias.
- Summarize participant experiences: Note how users felt or what they said about the product.
- Highlight impactful quotes: These can be used in reports to support findings.

### Examples from Participants

- Participant A: Frustrated tone; felt the app skipped key confirmation steps.
- Participant D: Positive tone but also confused; felt unclear about the booking process.
- Participant C: Liked the app but wanted more customization.

### Who Takes Notes?

- Usually, UX researchers lead and take notes.
- Other team members (designers, writers, etc.) should also take notes to catch issues specific to their roles.
- Notes are later consolidated into key insights to guide design improvements.

### How to Take Notes

- No single "correct" method.
- Options include:
  - Messy notes on paper
  - Sticky notes for sorting
  - Spreadsheets

### Why Use a Spreadsheet?

- Keeps notes organized in one place
- Helps recall important details without relying solely on recordings
- Makes it easier to identify usability patterns and issues

Spreadsheet structure (5 key columns):

1. **Task**

- List each task and participant’s name
- Set this up before the study begins

2. **Click Path**

- Record the steps (clicks) participants take to complete a task
- Reveals navigation behavior and product intuitiveness

3. **Observations**

- Note behaviors, attitudes, confusion, or usability issues
- Provides an indirect understanding of user experience

4. **Quotes**

- Capture key participant statements, both positive and negative
- Offers a direct view into user thoughts and expectations

5. **Task Completion**

- Rate task difficulty:

  - `1 = Easy`
  - `2 = Completed with difficulty`
  - `3 = Not completed`

**Extra Tip:**

- Use an **"Additional Notes"** section for any feedback shared after the session ends.
