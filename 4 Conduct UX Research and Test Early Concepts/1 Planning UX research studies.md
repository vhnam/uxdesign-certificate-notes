## Research study

A UX research study is a systematic process to understand users and their needs, helping designers solve user problems

A research study is a step-by-step examination of a group of users and their needs, which adds realistic context to the design process. UX researchers adopt various methods to uncover problems and design opportunities.

1. Plan the Study:

- Define the project's background, goals, and research questions.
- Decide on the study method and select participants.
- A strong plan sets the foundation for successful research.

2. Conduct the Research:

- Collect data using methods like usability studies, which assess how easily users can complete tasks in a design.

- Observe user interactions and conduct interviews to uncover pain points.

3. Analyze and Synthesize Results:

- Identify patterns and trends in both quantitative and qualitative data.
- Determine the meaning behind the data to inform design decisions.

4. Share and Promote Insights:

- Present your research findings and actionable recommendations to stakeholders (e.g., designers, engineers, managers).
- A clear, data-supported presentation increases the likelihood your recommendations will be implemented.

### Purpose of UX Research:

To understand real user needs and problems, ensuring product decisions are user-centered and cost-effective before launch.

## Benefits of testing phase research

Test phase research is essential during the UX design process, especially when the product reaches the prototype stage. Conducting user testing on prototypes allows the team to:

- Refine ideas and designs before finalizing the UI
- Make improvements early, saving time and effort before development
- Incorporate user feedback, leading to a better end-user experience after launch

Overall, testing at the prototype stage supports a more efficient and user-centered design process.

## Types of testing phase research

- UAT: Does it do what it's meant to?
- QA: Any errors / crashes?
- Accessibility evaluation: Does it meet accessibility standards?

## 1. Plan

- Project background: What led you to conduct this research? The context.
  - Benefits:
    - Gets the team on the same page
    - Shows you understand why you're doing it
    - Promotes confidence in overall quality
  - How:
    - Identify signals that indicated research was necessary
    - Describe previous research
    - List insights expected from research
- Research goals: What design problems are we trying to solve?
  - Categories:
    - Before design: Foundational research (why or if should build)
    - During: Design research (how to build)
    - After design: Post-launch research (if worked as expected)
- Research questions: What questions are we trying to answer?
  - Should be actionable
  - Should be specific
  - Should not be leading
- KPIs, e.g.:
  - Time on task: Time to complete a task
  - Use of navigation vs search: # using nav or search.
  - User error rates: E.g. clicking wrong icon, highlights unclear bits
  - Drop-off rates: How many users give up along the way
  - Conversation rate: % of users who complete desired action
  - System usability scale: Questionnaire about design
- Methodology: Documenting steps taken to conduct research.
- Participants: Who? What characteristics?
- Script AKA discussion guide: What will actually be asked?
  - Same set of questions for all
  - Ask open-ended questions
  - Encourage elaboration
  - Ask the same question from different angles(?)
  - Don't mention other users, could bias / privacy violation
  - No leading questions of course
