## Research study

1. Plan
   - Outline background
   - Set goals
   - Establish steps
   - Select participants
2. Research
   - Gather data (e.g. usability study)
3. Synthesize
   - Find meaning in the data
4. Share
   - E.g. presentation with method, data, conclusion, recommendations

## Types of testing

- UAT: Does it do what it's meant to?
- QA: Any errors / crashes?
- Accessibility: Does it meet accessibility standards?

## Elements of Research plan

- Project background: What led you to conduct this research? The context.
  - Benefits:
    - Gets the team on the same page
    - Shows you understand why you're doing it
    - Promotes confidence in overall quality
  - How:
    - Identify signals that indicated research was necessary
    - Describe previous research
    - List insights expected from research
- Research goals: What design problems are we trying to solve?
  - Categories:
    - Before design: Foundational research (why or if should build)
    - During: Design research (how to build)
    - After design: Post-launch research (if worked as expected)
- Research questions: What questions are we trying to answer?
  - Should be actionable
  - Should be specific
  - Should not be leading
- KPIs, e.g.:
  - Time on task: Time to complete a task
  - Use of navigation vs search: # using nav or search.
  - User error rates: E.g. clicking wrong icon, highlights unclear bits
  - Drop-off rates: How many users give up along the way
  - Conversation rate: % of users who complete desired action
  - System usability scale: Questionnaire about design
- Methodology: Documenting steps taken to conduct research.
- Participants: Who? What characteristics?
- Script AKA discussion guide: What will actually be asked?
  - Same set of questions for all
  - Ask open-ended questions
  - Encourage elaboration
  - Ask the same question from different angles(?)
  - Don't mention other users, could bias / privacy violation
  - No leading questions of course
