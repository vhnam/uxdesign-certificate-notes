## Research study

A UX research study is a systematic process to understand users and their needs, helping designers solve user problems

1. Plan
   - Outline background
   - Set goals
   - Establish steps
   - Select participants
2. Research
   - Gather data (e.g. usability study)
3. Synthesize
   - Find meaning in the data
4. Share
   - E.g. presentation with method, data, conclusion, recommendations

## Types of testing

- UAT: Does it do what it's meant to?
- QA: Any errors / crashes?
- Accessibility: Does it meet accessibility standards?

## Elements of Research plan

The introduction and research questions typically help design teams:

- Establish overarching research goals
- Identify who’s affected by the design
- Define the deliverables that the research should yield
- Ensure the quality of the research data

### Project background:

What led you to conduct this research? The context.

- Benefits:
  - Gets the team on the same page
  - Shows you understand why you're doing it
  - Promotes confidence in overall quality
- How:
  - Identify signals that indicated research was necessary
  - Describe previous research
  - List insights expected from research

### Research goals

What design problems are we trying to solve?

- Categories:

  - Before design: Foundational research (why or if should build)
  - During: Design research (how to build)
  - After design: Post-launch research (if worked as expected)

### Research questions

What questions are we trying to answer? These qualities ensure that questions guide useful, unbiased, and clear research findings.

- Actionable: The question should clearly indicate what kind of answer is expected, so researchers know when they've found the right information.
- Specific: Questions should focus on precise details to gather meaningful, relevant data.
- Neutral: Avoid phrasing questions that assume an answer or lead toward a bias.
- Methodological: The question should specify whether it requires quantitative (numerical) or qualitative (experiential) data.

### KPIs

- Time on task: Time to complete a task
- Use of navigation vs search: # using nav or search. The number of people who use a website or app’s navigation, compared to the number of people who use the search functionality
- User error rates: E.g. clicking wrong icon, highlights unclear bits
- Drop-off rates: How many users give up along the way
- Conversation rate: % of users who complete desired action
- System usability scale (SUS): Questionnaire about design
- The Net Promoter Score (NPS): gauges user loyalty by asking how likely they are to recommend a product on a scale from 0 to 10. Respondents are categorized as:

  - Promoters (9–10): Likely to recommend.
  - Passives (7–8): Satisfied but unlikely to recommend.
  - Detractors (0–6): May discourage others.

  NPS = % Promoters − % Detractors
  A positive score indicates user satisfaction, while a negative score suggests issues with the user experience.

### Methodology

Documenting steps taken to conduct research, outlining the specific steps for conducting the study—such as when, where, how, and by whom product tests and interviews will be done. Including methodology:

- Informs stakeholders about the study's logistics.
- Builds confidence in the results by showing clear procedures.
- Ensures the research is repeatable and reliable for future studies.

### Participants

Who? What characteristics?

The **participants** section focuses on selecting the right people to represent real users. Key points include:

- **Define participant characteristics** based on research goals, and justify each one (e.g., dog owners with full-time jobs for a dog-walking app).
- **Avoid sample bias** by ensuring participants reflect a broad and representative user base.
- **Use a screener survey** to identify suitable participants.
- **Offer incentives** (e.g., cash, gift cards, raffles) to encourage participation.
- **Include diverse perspectives and abilities**, especially users with disabilities, to ensure inclusive and accessible product design.
- A **representative sample** helps gather honest, useful feedback and ensures your product meets the needs of all potential users.

There are several ways to find participants for UX research:

- Existing user base: Ideal if you’re working with a company that already has users.
- Online: Use social media, design communities, or platforms like UserTesting and User Interviews. Be mindful of excluding offline users.
- Hallway testing: A quick, informal method where you ask passersby (e.g., in a dog park or café) to try your design. Best for small-scale, low-budget studies but may not represent your target users well.
- Incentives: Offer compensation (e.g., money, gift cards, meals) to encourage participation, regardless of how you recruit.

When selecting participants for a UX research study:

- Define key characteristics based on your research goals and target users.
- Use a screener survey to ensure participants match those characteristics and represent a diverse and inclusive sample.
- Aim for a representative sample that includes marginalized groups (e.g., people with disabilities or limited tech access) to ensure equitable, accessible design.
- Do not ask directly about disability status—instead, recruit based on use of assistive technologies (e.g., screen readers, closed captions, keyboard-only navigation).
- Participants provide vital feedback that shapes your product.
- Ideal sample size: 5–8 participants to balance insights and efficiency.

To create inclusive and equitable designs, **UX designers must include participants with diverse abilities** in their research. This ensures accessibility (or **a11y**)—designing products usable by people with disabilities.

Key points:

- **Accessibility benefits everyone**, not just people with permanent disabilities. It also supports those with temporary or situational impairments.

  - _Permanent:_ e.g., blindness.
  - _Temporary:_ e.g., blurry vision without glasses.
  - _Situational:_ e.g., needing voice commands while driving.

- **Assistive technologies (ATs)** enhance usability for people with various needs. Examples include:

  - **Screen readers** (for low vision).
  - **Switch devices** (for limited mobility).
  - **Closed captions/speech-to-text** (for hearing impairments).
  - **Reminder alarms/Action Blocks** (for cognitive challenges).
  - **AAC devices** (for speech or learning disabilities).

Including users of ATs in research ensures that products are more accessible—and better—for all users.

### Script AKA discussion guide

A script (discussion guide) ensures interviews are consistent, purposeful, and aligned with research goals. Key points include:

#### Why use a script:

- Prevents forgetting instructions or key questions.
- Keeps language and structure consistent across participants.

#### Tips for writing interview questions:

1. **Use the same questions** for every participant to maintain consistency.
2. **Ask open-ended questions** to elicit detailed insights (avoid yes/no).
3. **Encourage elaboration** by prompting participants to expand on short answers.
4. **Rephrase key questions** to get deeper, more honest responses.
5. **Avoid mentioning other users** to prevent bias and privacy issues.
6. **Avoid leading questions** that suggest a particular answer.

#### Script structure:

1. **Welcome participants** and thank them for joining.
2. **Inform them** about recording and get **consent**.
3. Collect **basic info** (name, age, occupation).
4. **Reassure** them they're not being tested—just give honest feedback.
5. Allow for **questions** before starting.
6. Present **usability tasks** (aka "activities") that align with your research goals. Tasks should:
   - Be action-based and specific.
   - Avoid giving hints.
   - Example: “Book a dog walker on Friday at 2:00 p.m.”
7. After tasks, **ask follow-up questions**, stop recording, and **thank the participant**.

#### A well-designed script

**1. Introduction**

- Requests **consent to record** the session.
- Clarifies the session **is not a test**—there are no right or wrong answers.
- Encourages participants to **ask questions**.
- Explains **why data is being collected**.
- Gathers **basic info** about the participant’s relationship with the product.

These steps:

- Collect valuable **demographic data**.
- Set a **professional tone**.
- Help participants **feel at ease**.

**2. Prompts and Follow-up Questions**

- Prompts are **tasks** participants perform to test specific KPIs.
- Follow-ups explore the participant’s **experience**, giving context to their actions.

**3. Style and Tone**

Prompts and questions should be:

- **Open-ended** – Encourage detailed responses.
- **Objective** – Avoid bias or hints.
- **Goal-oriented** – Directly tied to research goals and KPIs.

Together, these elements ensure researchers gather **rich, actionable insights** about the user experience.

## Respecting User Privacy and Data

Respecting user privacy is essential in UX research for **ethical, legal, and brand trust** reasons. Here’s what you need to know:

**Why Privacy Matters**

- It’s the **ethical thing to do**—protecting users’ rights and integrity.
- **Legal compliance**: Privacy laws vary globally; violating them can have serious consequences.
- **Data breaches** are a real risk; exposed data can lead to harm or discrimination.
- **Brand trust**: Respecting privacy builds user trust and protects your organization’s reputation.

**What Data to Protect**

1. **Personally Identifiable Information (PII)**:

   - Includes name, email, address, phone number.

2. **Sensitive PII (SPII)**:

   - Includes social security number, date of birth, financial info, disability status, gender, race, criminal history, etc.
   - If exposed, this can cause serious harm to users.

**Best Practices for Privacy in UX Research**

- **Be transparent**: Clearly explain what data you collect and why.
- **Minimize data collection**: Only gather what’s essential.
- **Obtain active, informed consent**: Use consent forms and explain participants’ rights.
- **Anonymize participant data**: Use generic labels (e.g., Person One) or group quotes.
- **Allow withdrawal at any time**: Make the process simple and explicit.
- **Limit data access**: Share only with relevant team members.
- **Define data storage and deletion**: Use secure storage and state when data will be deleted.

Privacy and data protection are not just best practices—they are your **responsibility** as a designer and researcher.

## Special Privacy Concerns

**Vulnerable Populations**

- Certain groups have **limited ability to provide informed consent** or have **heightened privacy concerns**.
- Examples: **Minors, people with disabilities, the elderly, incarcerated individuals, LGBTQIA+ community members**.
- Vulnerability depends on context, culture, and research type.
- Always consult a **research expert** for ethical and legal guidance when working with these groups.

**Research Data Safety**

1. **Data Recording**

   - Follow **standard UX documentation practices** for consistency, comparison, and audit readiness.

2. **Data Storage**

   - Ensure data is **secure from hacking** and **protected from physical damage**.

3. **Data Retention**

   - Understand **how long to keep data** based on company policy or legal requirements.
   - Clarify **data ownership** if you leave the company.

**Privacy Protection Tools**

- **De-identification**

  - Remove identifying information (e.g., use “Participant 1” or fictitious names and neutral pronouns like “they”) when sharing insights.

- **Non-Disclosure Agreements (NDAs)**

  - Protect your **ideas, products, and intellectual property** during testing.
  - NDAs are legal contracts that prevent participants from sharing what they've seen or experienced.

Protecting participant privacy—especially for vulnerable populations—and safeguarding your research data with proper practices and tools like **de-identification** and **NDAs** is crucial for ethical, legal, and professional UX research.
