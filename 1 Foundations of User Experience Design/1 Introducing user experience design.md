## What is UX

### Definitions

- UX Designers: Take technology easier to understand and more enjoyable to use
- User experience: How a person, the user, feels about interacting with or experiencing a product.
- Product: A good, service, or feature.
- Assets: Text, images, font style, spacing, etc.

A good experience includes:

- Usable: Design / structure / purpose of the product clear to everyone.
- Equitable: Designs are useful & marketable to diverse audience.
- Enjoyable: Enjoyable to use, create a positive connection. Take user's thoughts & feelings into consideration.
- Useful: Solves a problem.

### Roles

#### Designers

- Interaction designers: Focus on designing the experience of a product and how it functions. E.g. what happens when this button is pressed, how are the element laid out.
- Visual designers: Focus on how a product or technology looks. E.g. what style should the button be.
- Motion designers: Think about what it feels like for a user to move through a product. E.g. which animation should be used.
- Graphic designers: Create visuals that tell a story or message.

#### Colleagues

- UX researchers: Conduct studies or interviews to help learn how people use a product.
- UX writers: Use language to make user experience more intuitive.
- UX engineers: Translate design intent into a functioning experience.
- UX program manager: Managing the project (e.g. goals, project plans).
- Production designers: Bridge between interaction designers and engineers, check the first designs match the final designs, and they're ready to be worked on.

### UX tools overview

Quoted verbatim:

> **Sketch, Freehand, and Zeplin**
>
> - Work well with very large teams that may struggle to adopt new tools
> - Paired most commonly with another of these tools
> - Do not require WiFi, enabling offline design work
> - Do not afford real-time collaboration, prototyping, or design to development collaborative activities
>
> **Adobe XD**
>
> - Works well with teams that already use Adobe's Suite
> - Rounds out Adobe's suite of products with one that is entirely built for digital and UX design work
> - Syncs to Cloud rather than using actual real-time collaboration and can be used offline
>
> **Figma**
>
> - Is excellent for most designers and contexts
> - Includes FigJam access, a whiteboard for brainstorming, diagramming, and strategizing
> - Requires WiFi connection
> - Is a digital-first, remote-friendly, all-in-one tool, allowing for easier sharing, designing, collaboration, and reviewing in our ever-changing, more virtual workspace

### Product development lifecycle

Process of taking product from idea to reality.

1. Brainstorm: Generate ideas about the user, needs, and challenges. Research is key.
2. Define: Use insights and narrow the focus, so define specific features etc.
3. Design: Develop ideas, check all is realistic. Includes storyboards, wireframes, prototypes.
4. Test: Evaluate product design based on feedback from potential users. Includes interactions between devs and designers.
5. Launch: Actually releasing the product.

## Feedback

A reasonable intro! I liked the focus on TYPES of designer, this was all new to me. Similarly, discussing generalist vs specialists is useful.
