## Design thinking

An iterative, user-centred framework.

1. Empathize: Learn about the user, step back from assumptions / guesses.
   - Questionnaires, surveys, in-person interviews, phone interviews, video interviews.
   - Empathy maps can process the data collected, e.g. who are users, what do they say / think about their experiences, and what do they do / feel before, during, after experiences?
   - User personas (segments represented by fictional entity).
2. Define: Analyze findings, determine which user problems are most important. Outcome is a clear statement of what need will be solved by design.
   - User story, e.g. "as x, I want to y, so that z".
   - User journeys, e.g. the steps the user takes to try and achieve their goal.
   - Problem statements: X is a Y who needs Z because ABC. Like user stories, but from designer perspective.
3. Ideate: Brainstorming, generate solutions. Start making choices about best options to prototype.
   - "How might we?"
   - "Crazy Eights" / Rapid Sketching: 8 minutes, 1 minute per square / box, propose a solution in each.
   - See what competitors do, weaknesses, strengths.
   - SCAMPER used to brainstorm ideas and changes: Substitute, Combine, Adapt, Modify, Put to another use, Eliminate, Rearrange.
4. Prototype: Build a basic model, might be static or on paper.
   - Wireframes (paper or digital).
   - Low fidelity prototypes: Basic wireframes with interactivity for navigating etc.
   - High fidelity prototypes: Realistic content and interactions on top of low-fidelity.
5. Test: Let users try the prototypes, incorporate their feedback.
   - Who will participate?
   - What kind of tests?
   - When, where, why are tests being conducted?
   - Validate ideas / info / decisions
   - Uncover usability issues
   - How will participants engage?
   - How will info be collected?

## Design sprints

Time bound, five phases typically spread over 5x 8hr days. Goal is to solve critical design challenge by designing, prototyping, testing solutions. Different departments can use!

### Benefits:

- Save time
- Create path to bring product to market
- Prioritize the user
- Test product before launch
- Value every person in the room
- Best designs float to the top
- Lowers risks to launching
- Versatile, can be used at any point in a project

### When to sprint:

- Many potential solutions to challenge?
- Cross-functional teams needed to weigh in?
- Challenge scope wide enough to justify?

### Stages (each phase takes up to a day)

A design sprint includes five phases:

1. Understand: Get a clear picture of the design challenge. Learn from experts, have creative discussions with other departments / industries.
   - Speak with customer service team to learn about topics that matter to site visitors.
   - Meet with development team to explore various features.
2. Ideate: Come up with ideas, sketch and present ideas.
   - Start recruiting skateboarding enthusiasts for testing.
   - Each team member sketches some concepts and presents them to the team.
3. Decide: Decide which solutions to build based on goals / challenge. End day by blueprinting prototype.
   - Discuss the presented features and how they address the challenge to increase engagement.
   - Agree on designing a discussion board feature.
4. Prototype: Goal is something realistic enough to test with users. Also finish user test schedule.
   - Build a working prototype of the discussion board feature.
5. Testing: Observe, interview.
   - Observe how users react to your prototype.
   - Interview users about what it was like to use your prototype.

### How to plan:

1. User research to identify the actual challenge
2. Talk to experts (or colleagues) for during "Understand"
3. Find the right space physically, e.g. acoustics, furniture, whiteboard.
4. Gather supplies (very literal, paper / pen / snacks)
5. Establish sprint rules (e.g. no phones)
6. Plan introductions (e.g. icebreakers)
7. Post-sprint planning (documenting, next steps)

### Design sprint retrospective

The goal is to make sure everyone who took part in the sprint has a chance to give feedback. The two key questions

- What went well
- what can be improved?

A retrospective is a collaborative `critique` of the design sprint process.

```
- What did you plan to do together?
- What went well?
- What could have been improved?
- What would you do differently next time?
```
