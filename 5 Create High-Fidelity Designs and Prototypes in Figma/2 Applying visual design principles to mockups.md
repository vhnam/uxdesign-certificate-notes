## Emphasis

1. Emphasis Defined: Emphasis is about guiding the viewer's attention to the most important parts of a design. In daily life, this could be a speaker emphasizing certain words, or a pianist emphasizing particular notes to maintain attention and clarity. In design, it serves the same purpose by guiding the user’s focus.

2. Creating Emphasis: To create emphasis, you need to give an element visual weight—which is the force that draws the eye. You can do this through size, color, or contrast. For example, larger and colorful images have more visual weight than surrounding elements, which is why they draw the user’s focus.

3. Strategic Consideration: When deciding what to emphasize, consider:

- User’s Goals: What do you want the user to notice or do?

- Task Completion: What part of your design is essential for helping the user complete their tasks?

4. Examples:

- In a spice-tracking app mockup, large, colorful images of spices stand out more than the background or text, making the app’s main content easy to find.

- In a dog walker booking app, the "Book Sarah" button is highlighted with bold orange color and larger size to guide users to take action, making it the focus of the screen.

5. Takeaway: Emphasis is about strategically drawing attention to critical elements to improve user experience and task completion.

**Emphasis** means that an object or element is attracting attention. When part of a design has emphasis, the user’s eye is drawn there when they look at an app screen or webpage.

How to choose what to emphasise:

- Where do I want to draw the user's attentions?
- What are the user's goals?

How to emphasise:

- Size
- Contrast
- Texture

## Hierarchy

1. Hierarchy Defined: Hierarchy is a design principle that orders elements based on their importance, helping to guide the user's focus. It’s distinct from emphasis, which highlights a single element, whereas hierarchy organizes multiple elements according to their relative importance.

2. Creating Hierarchy:

- Size and color are commonly used to establish hierarchy. Larger and bolder elements tend to grab more attention, while smaller or subtler elements support the primary content.

- Example: On a news website, headlines are the most important and are typically larger and bolder than the summary text, which is smaller and less prominent.

3. Why Hierarchy Matters:

- It helps users understand where to focus first and what actions to take in their user journey. In UX design, hierarchy ensures that users are guided to the most important content or actions in the correct order.

4. Example from Dog Walker App:

- In a dog walker booking app, text hierarchy is used to guide users through the steps of the booking process. Important text like "Select the dog walker" is larger, while secondary information (e.g., dog walker names) is smaller or in a lighter color to show importance. This helps users prioritize information logically.

5. Hierarchy & Accessibility:

- Hierarchy also improves accessibility. Using accessibility annotations in designs (like wireframes or mockups) helps screen readers read elements in the correct order. This ensures users with disabilities can navigate the design effectively.

**Hierarchy** helps the user know where to focus first and what action to take. Also helps create a well-structured, easy-to-navigate design that guides users effectively and enhances accessibility.

## Scale and Proportion in UX Design

### Definitions

- **Scale**: The size relationship between one element and others in a design.
- **Proportion**: The balance or harmony among scaled elements, ensuring their size relationships make sense.

### Using Scale in Design

- Emphasizes important elements by making them larger than others.
- Creates contrast and draws user attention.
- Helps users understand **relative size** through comparison.
  - Example: Showing earrings next to a coin to indicate real-world size.
  - Example: In the **Google TV app**, the featured movie image ("Love and Monsters") is larger than others, guiding attention to it first.

### Using Proportion in Design

- Ensures elements are **visually balanced** and their relationships feel natural.
- Disproportionate examples (clowns’ big shoes, T-rex’s small arms) illustrate imbalance.
- In UX, subtle proportion changes help categorize and differentiate content:
  - Example: In the **Google TV app**, “Romance” and “Mystery” use square thumbnails, while “Popular family films” use vertical rectangles — signaling a different type of content.

### Creating Visual Balance

- Combining scale and proportion effectively helps maintain a **clean, balanced layout**.
- Subtle changes guide user focus and improve usability.
- Designers can explore ratios (like the **Golden Ratio**) to enhance visual harmony.

## Unity and Variety in UX & Visual Design

### Definitions

- **Unity**: How well design elements work together to communicate a single idea and achieve a product goal.
  - Creates a **pleasing**, **clear**, and **cohesive** experience.
  - Achieved through:
    - Consistent color schemes
    - Complementary fonts
    - Even spacing
    - Alignment, shape consistency, and typography harmony
- **Variety**: The intentional use of diverse elements to break monotony, sustain user interest, and add visual appeal.
  - Introduces **energy**, **contrast**, and **emphasis** through:
    - Shapes
    - Colors
    - Textures
    - Patterns

> Repetition builds familiarity, but too much repetition can make a design dull. A balanced mix of unity and variety keeps interfaces both engaging and usable.

### Unity

#### Purpose

- Ensures all elements work together toward the **product’s goal**.
- Builds structure and consistency so users can easily navigate and understand the layout.
- Contributes to an experience that feels **organized, clean, and intentional**.

#### Key Aspects of Unity

1. **Alignment of Elements**

   - Elements should align spatially even if their shapes differ.
   - Example: In the **YouTube Music app**, video rectangles and artist circles align by the space they occupy, not by shape.

2. **Shape Consistency**

   - Repeating shapes reinforces order and clarity.
   - Example: Playlist boxes in YouTube Music share the same **scale, proportion, and size**, creating visual balance.

3. **Text Continuity**

   - Consistent font, color, and alignment create rhythm and unity.
   - Example: Section headings and descriptions in YouTube Music share uniform typography, making the layout cohesive.

4. **Color and Spacing**
   - Consistent use of colors and spacing improves legibility and helps users predict structure.

#### Applying Unity to Your Designs

- In **low-fidelity wireframes**, focus on **function**, not unity yet.
- In **mockups**, apply unity intentionally:
  - Use colors consistently and purposefully.
  - Ensure typefaces work well together.
  - Maintain equal spacing between elements.
- Revisit your **goal statement** — every element should support it. Remove unnecessary ones.

### Variety

#### Purpose

- Keeps designs visually stimulating and engaging.
- Breaks monotony in repetitive layouts.
- Adds **focus and energy** to the interface.

#### Strategic Use

- **Variety in Emphasis**:
  - Example: In a **news app**, most stories are dark text on white backgrounds (unity), but **breaking news** might use bright red or yellow backgrounds (variety) to signal urgency.
- **Variety in Layout**:
  - Example: In **Google Photos**, designers mix rectangular and square images to maintain visual interest without breaking consistency.

#### Applying Variety to Your Designs

- Identify repetitive areas and introduce small variations through:
  - Size
  - Shape
  - Color
  - Texture
- Use variety strategically to:
  - Highlight key actions or areas (e.g., bright buttons)
  - Guide user attention without creating chaos
  - Add liveliness to minimal or simple products

#### Example: Dog Walker App

- **Unity**: Consistent orange color scheme and even spacing create a harmonious, clean layout.
- **Variety**: The orange “Choose a time” button contrasts with neutral tones, guiding users toward action.

### Balancing Unity and Variety

- **Unity and variety work best together** — they are not opposites but complements.
- **Too much unity** → Users struggle to find what’s important.
- **Too much variety** → Layout feels chaotic and hard to read.
- **The goal is balance**:
  - Use **unity** for clarity and cohesion.
  - Use **variety** for emphasis and engagement.
  - Combine both for an intuitive, visually pleasing experience.

### Thinking of Overall Product Design

- Consider **unity and variety early** in the design process.
- Thoughtfully combining both principles helps create:
  - **Consistent** interfaces
  - **Engaging** experiences
  - **User-friendly** products that hold attention

## Gestalt Principles in UX Design

### Definition

- **Gestalt principles** describe how humans naturally **group elements**, **recognize patterns**, and **simplify complex visuals** by perceiving parts as a cohesive whole.
- The brain is wired to seek **structure, logic, and order**, helping designers understand how users interpret visual compositions.

> Gestalt theory helps UX designers step back from individual details to see how all design elements work together as a unified experience.

### Core Principles Covered

#### 1. Similarity

- **Definition**: Elements that look alike are perceived to serve the same function or belong to the same group.
- **Purpose**: Creates visual consistency and predictable interaction patterns.
- **Examples**:
  - In the **dog walker app**, all **orange elements** (tabs, check marks, buttons) represent user actions — users quickly learn this shared meaning.
  - Circular icons consistently represent **user profiles** (whether photo or initials), helping users instantly recognize them.

#### Design Takeaway

- Use **color**, **shape**, and **visual weight** to signal related elements.
- Maintain consistency across screens to strengthen users’ mental model.

#### 2. Proximity

- **Definition**: Elements that are close together are perceived as related; those farther apart seem unrelated.
- **Purpose**: Indicates relationships between elements without explicit visual separators.
- **Examples**:
  - Words are formed by the **close proximity of letters**; space separates words — a natural example of this principle.
  - In the **dog walker app**, pet name buttons (“Charlie,” “Broccoli,” “Rover”) appear close together under the question _“Who is going for a walk?”_  
    → Their proximity shows they belong to that question.
  - The **recurring booking box** is positioned farther away, signaling a separate function.

#### Design Takeaway

- Adjust spacing to clarify **hierarchy** and **relationships** between interface elements.
- Avoid crowding unrelated items.

#### 3. Common Region

- **Definition**: Elements placed within the same area or boundary are perceived as part of a group.
- **Purpose**: Organizes information into clear visual sections.
- **Examples**:
  - In **Kaiwei’s Rostery app** (for professors to memorize students):
    - Three sections — navigation bar, progress graph, and student list — are visually grouped using **borders** and **sections**.
  - In the **dog walker app**, items on a **blue background** form one region (selected dog walker), while white areas indicate unselected content.

#### Design Takeaway

- Use **containers**, **background colors**, or **borders** to define logical regions and reinforce grouping.

### Visual Balance and Gestalt

- **Visual balance**: When a design feels evenly weighted across its center, creating a sense of completeness.
- Applying Gestalt principles supports this balance by aligning with how the human brain naturally organizes visual information.

### Key Takeaways

- Gestalt principles guide designers to create **order, clarity, and harmony** in interfaces.
- Use them to:
  - Reinforce **functionality** through visual similarity.
  - Show **relationships** with proximity.
  - Group **content** via common regions.
- Thoughtful application leads to **visually balanced**, **intuitive**, and **user-friendly** designs.

## Advanced Gestalt Principles in UX Design

### Overview

- **Gestalt principles** explain how humans **group, recognize, and simplify visual elements** to perceive complete, organized patterns.
- Applying these principles helps designers create **psychologically intuitive, engaging, and user-friendly** mockups.
- Previously learned:
  - **Similarity**: Similar-looking elements are perceived to share a function.
  - **Proximity**: Close elements appear related.
  - **Common region**: Elements within the same area are grouped together.

Now, three additional principles expand this understanding: **Closure**, **Continuity**, and **Symmetry**.

### Closure

- **Definition**: When users see an incomplete object, their minds fill in the gaps to form a complete, recognizable shape.
- **Purpose**: Keeps users engaged by prompting visual completion and attention.
- **Examples**:
  - **Graphic example**: Lines that suggest, but don’t fully form, a red square, blue circle, and yellow triangle — the brain completes these shapes.
  - **FedEx logo**: The **arrow** formed between the “E” and “x” uses closure to symbolize **movement and direction**, reinforcing the brand’s delivery purpose.
- **Design takeaway**:
  - Use **implied shapes or negative space** to encourage engagement and visual curiosity.
  - Suggest, rather than explicitly draw, elements to keep designs intriguing.

### Continuity

- **Definition**: Elements arranged along a **line or curve** are perceived as related, guiding the user’s eye in a smooth visual path.
- **Purpose**: Directs user attention across related content or processes.
- **Examples**:
  - **Graphic example**: The eye follows a continuous white line through multiple circles.
  - **USPS website**: The **vertical navigation menu** guides users smoothly through “Send” → “Learn About” → “Sending,” following a logical flow.
- **Design takeaway**:
  - Use lines, shapes, or layout direction to **lead users naturally** through steps or content.
  - Apply continuity in **menus, progress indicators, or process flows**.

### Symmetry

- **Definition**: Balanced or mirrored elements are **more visually pleasing** and perceived as related.
- **Purpose**: Establishes harmony and order; can also use asymmetry to highlight key content.
- **Examples**:
  - **Symmetry graphic**: Two mirror-image shapes (dark green and light green) feel stable and related.
  - **Asymmetry graphic**: Different shapes (straight-lined vs. curved) create contrast and draw attention.
  - **Alan Turing Institute website**: Uses **asymmetrical layout** — varying text sizes and placement — to emphasize important information.
- **Design takeaway**:
  - Use **symmetry** for balance and unity.
  - Use **asymmetry** for emphasis and visual interest.
  - The right balance depends on your design’s **intent and hierarchy**.

### Key Takeaways

- Gestalt principles align design with how the **human brain naturally organizes information**.
- Thoughtful use of **closure, continuity, and symmetry** enhances:
  - **Engagement** — users interact longer when visuals are intuitive.
  - **Clarity** — visual relationships are easier to interpret.
  - **Aesthetics** — balance between order and creative emphasis.
- Always return to **user needs** and refine your mockups to achieve both **psychological clarity** and **visual harmony**.

## Four-Step Checklist for Reviewing Your Mockups

### Overview

Before finalizing your mockups, it’s essential to **pause and review** your design from different perspectives.  
A structured **four-step checklist** helps ensure that your design is consistent, functional, and cohesive — from small details to the big picture.

### 1. Detail-Level View

- **Focus:** Individual elements such as **typography, color, and iconography**.
- **Goal:** Ensure visual consistency and fix small errors.
- **Example:** In the dog walker app, one icon mistakenly used color **#f18530** instead of the consistent **#fa7b17**.
- **Ask:**
  - Are colors and fonts consistent?
  - Are all icons uniform in style and placement?

### 2. Page-Level View

- **Focus:** The **balance and unity** of elements within each page.
- **Goal:** Create visually pleasing pages with proper **scale and proportion**.
- **Example:** In the “Book Appointment” page:
  - Bios were misaligned, causing imbalance → fixed by **left-aligning** all text.
  - Checkmark icons stood alone → improved by adding **gray circles** for visual balance.
- **Ask:**
  - Are elements evenly distributed and visually balanced?
  - Does the hierarchy of information make sense?

### 3. Function-Level View

- **Focus:** The **operational flow** — ensuring all interactive elements are present.
- **Goal:** Verify that the design is **ready for prototyping** and user navigation.
- **Checklist:**
  - Each page has a way to move **forward and backward**.
  - A button exists for the **main action** of the page.
  - Undo or cancel actions are available if needed.
- **Example:**
  - Check for **Back arrow**, **X button**, and the main **Book Dog Walker** action button.

### 4. App-Level View

- **Focus:** The **entire app design** across all pages.
- **Goal:** Ensure global consistency and cohesive branding.
- **How to do it:**
  - Zoom out in **Figma** to see multiple screens together.
  - Check that repeating elements (e.g., top navigation icons) stay in **the same position** across pages.
- **Ask:**
  - Does the app look unified overall?
  - Are patterns and layouts consistent between screens?

### Key Takeaways

- Reviewing your mockups through **four perspectives** — detail, page, function, and app — helps refine your design systematically.
- Each pass through the checklist brings your mockup **closer to a polished, professional, and user-ready design**.
- Iteration is continuous — every tweak improves clarity, consistency, and usability.

## Additional Visual Design Elements in UX

### Overview

As you refine **high-fidelity designs**, you’ll focus more on **visuals, aesthetics, and functionality**.  
Key visual elements — **value, saturation, orientation, intrinsic interest, and perceived physical weight** — help create contrast, clarity, and engagement in your design.

### Value

- **Definition:** A color’s **lightness or darkness**.
  - The lightest value = **white**
  - The darkest value = **black**
- **Purpose:** Creates **contrast** and improves **readability**.
- **Example:**
  - Light text or icons stand out against a dark background.
  - Tools often let you adjust value using a sliding scale (adding white or black).

**Design takeaway:**  
Use contrast in value to make key elements visible and ensure accessibility.

### Saturation

- **Definition:** The **intensity or purity** of a color.
  - High saturation → bold, vivid color
  - Low saturation → muted, greyish tones
- **Purpose:** Draws **attention** and controls **visual energy**.
- **Examples:**
  - Neon lights, highlighters, and sirens use **high saturation** for emphasis.
  - Desaturated palettes create a **calm, subtle** aesthetic.

**Design takeaway:**  
Use high saturation to emphasize; use low saturation for balance and readability.

### Orientation

- **Definition:** The **layout direction** of a design — **horizontal**, **vertical**, or **square**.
- **Purpose:** Ensures designs adapt well across devices.
- **Examples:**
  - Desktops → horizontal (landscape) layouts
  - Phones/tablets → vertical or horizontal
  - Smartwatches → square layouts
- **Design takeaway:**
  - Plan designs with **grid-based structures** that adjust to different device orientations.

### Intrinsic Interest

- **Definition:** The **visual appeal** or **eye-catching quality** of a design element.
- **Purpose:** Directs attention and establishes visual hierarchy.
- **Examples:**
  - Large, bold **titles** and **colorful graphics** attract attention.
  - **Images** and **animations** often draw the eye before text.
  - **Serif fonts** for titles and **sans-serif fonts** for body text create natural contrast.

**Design takeaway:**  
Make important elements visually distinctive; let less important ones blend in.

### Perceived Physical Weight

- **Definition:** The **illusion of mass or volume** an element conveys.
- **Purpose:** Creates balance and realism by showing proportional relationships between elements.
- **Example:**
  - A large jug looks heavier than a small measuring cup — similar logic applies in digital design when balancing element sizes and proportions.

**Design takeaway:**  
Use **size, proportion, and visual density** to communicate hierarchy and importance.

### Key Takeaways

- These elements — **value, saturation, orientation, intrinsic interest, and perceived physical weight** — enhance both the **look** and **usability** of designs.
- Each visual choice should be **intentional** and rooted in user experience.
- Combining these principles helps create **appealing, accessible, and meaningful** designs.

## Navigation Design in UX

### Overview

Good **navigation design** ensures users can **move easily and intuitively** through an app or website.  
Confusing navigation creates frustration, while clear navigation enhances user satisfaction and engagement.

### Types of Navigation

#### 1. Navigation Bar

- **Definition:** A single horizontal or vertical bar showing key page links.
- **Purpose:** Gives users quick access to the most important pages.
- **Example:**
  - In **Lisa’s Lucere app**, the navigation bar runs across the top for clear, consistent access to main sections.
- **Best for:**
  - Simple websites (e.g., portfolios) or apps that need visible, global navigation.

#### 2. Tab Bar

- **Definition:** Displays links as clickable tabs (text, icons, or both).
- **Purpose:** Keeps users focused within a single area of content without leaving the main screen.
- **Example:**
  - In **Kartik’s Google Clock app**, the tab bar runs across the top, highlighting the active tab with an underline.
- **Best for:**
  - Sorting related content and improving engagement within an app’s section.

#### 3. Navigation Menu

- **Definition:** A collapsible or hidden menu, often represented by a **three-line (hamburger)** icon.
- **Purpose:** Saves space by keeping menus hidden until needed.
- **Location:** Usually top-left or top-right corner.
- **Best for:**
  - Apps with many links or limited screen space.
  - Clean, minimalist layouts.

#### 4. Navigation Hub

- **Definition:** The homepage displays a **collection of navigation links**; users return to it to switch pages.
- **Purpose:** Simplifies navigation for small websites with limited pages.
- **Example:**
  - In **Tongfang’s portfolio site**, each page links back to the homepage where navigation is centralized.
- **Best for:**
  - Lightweight products or simple portfolios.
  - Not ideal for multitasking or deep content structures.

### Navigational Design Elements

#### Buttons

- Can be fully styled or simple clickable text/icons.
- Often include **animations or underlines** to signal interactivity.

#### Icons

- Act as **visual shortcuts** understood universally.
  - ✉️ Envelope → email
  - 🏠 House → homepage
  - 🔗 Social media logo → platform link

### Affordances in Navigation

- **Definition:** Visual cues that indicate an element’s **purpose or interactivity**.
- **Purpose:** Helps users understand how to interact with the interface intuitively.
- **Example:**
  - A text link with an underline or hover animation signals it’s **clickable**.
- **Design takeaway:**
  - Every interactive element (button, icon, text) should **look actionable**.

### Key Takeaways

- Choose a navigation type that fits your **product’s structure and user goals**:
  - **Navigation bars** → simple, visible navigation
  - **Tab bars** → section-based engagement
  - **Menus** → compact and organized
  - **Hubs** → simple, single-page navigation
- Use **affordances** (like icons and visual cues) to clarify interactions.
- Design navigation that’s **simple, intuitive, and consistent** to improve overall usability.
