## Planning a UX Research Study

### Overview

A UX research plan is a **step-by-step guide** to study users and their needs. It contains **seven elements** that structure and guide the research process.

### Seven Elements of a UX Research Plan

1. **Project Background**

   - Explains the situation leading to the need for research.
   - Answers: _“What led you to conduct this research?”_
   - Acts as a brief summary for stakeholders.

2. **Research Goals**

   - Define what you aim to solve or learn.
   - Fit into one of three categories depending on product life cycle stage.
   - Answers: _“How will research results impact design decisions?”_

3. **Research Questions**

   - Specific, actionable questions the study aims to answer.
   - Not the same as participant interview questions.
   - Avoid leading or vague phrasing.

4. **Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)**

   - Quantitative measures of success or progress.
   - Examples:
     - Time spent on tasks
     - Use of navigation vs. search
     - Error rates, drop-off rates, conversion rates
     - System Usability Scale (SUS)
   - Answers: _“What would indicate progress toward our goal?”_

5. **Methodology**

   - Describes how the research will be conducted.
   - Includes steps for data collection and analysis.

6. **Participants**

   - Defines who will take part in the study.
   - Ensures the right audience and metrics are being studied.

7. **Script / Discussion Guide**
   - List of questions to ask participants during the study.
   - Guides the moderator through the usability test.

### Key Reminder

- The **research plan** connects **project goals**, **methods**, and **metrics** into one cohesive framework.

## Conducting a UX Research Study

### Overview

This is the **second step** in the UX research process — **conducting the research**.  
It focuses on running **usability studies** to evaluate how easily users can complete key tasks.

### Usability Studies

- **Definition:**  
  A research method used to assess how easy it is for participants to complete core tasks in a product.
- **Purpose:**  
  Researchers observe participants using a prototype to identify usability issues and improve the design.

### Types of Usability Studies

#### 1. Moderated Studies

- A **moderator** guides participants through the study in real time.
- **Moderator’s role:**
  - Assign tasks to participants.
  - Observe interactions.
  - Collect feedback and ask follow-up questions.
- **Advantages:**
  - Real-time clarification and rapport building.
  - In-depth understanding through follow-up questions.

#### 2. Unmoderated Studies

- Participants complete tasks **independently**, without a moderator.
- Usually **recorded on video** for later review.
- **Advantages:**
  - Participants complete tasks in their own space and time.
  - Encourages honest, natural feedback.

### Multiple Usability Studies

- Conducted at **different stages** of the design process:
  - Example: low-fidelity prototype → high-fidelity prototype.
- **Reason:**  
  Each design version offers new insights to improve the user experience.
- **Timing consideration:**  
  The later the study, the **more costly** it is to implement changes.

### Study Size

- Recommended starting point: **around five participants.**
  - Enough to gather useful data.
  - Keeps costs and time manageable.

### Key Takeaway

- **Conducting research** means observing users in action to identify pain points.
- Choose between **moderated or unmoderated** methods based on goals and resources.
- Repeated usability studies throughout design help refine and validate the product.

## Analyzing and Synthesizing UX Research Data

### Overview

This is **step three** in the UX research process — **analyze and synthesize the data** gathered during usability studies.  
The goal is to transform raw observations into **actionable insights** that guide design improvements.

### Definition of Insights

- **Insight:** An observation that helps you understand users or their needs from a new perspective.
- **Purpose:** Explains what the data means and how it can inform design decisions.

### Four Steps to Turn Observations into Insights

1. **Gather Data**

   - Collect all notes, observations, and feedback from the usability study.
   - Include every detail from all observers.

2. **Organize Data**

   - Structure the collected information consistently.
   - Common methods:
     - **Affinity diagramming**
     - **Spreadsheet note-taking**

3. **Find Themes**

   - Identify recurring patterns or behaviors across participants.
   - Themes reveal shared pain points or successes.

4. **Create Insights**
   - Develop a list of clear, actionable insights based on the themes.
   - Strong insights:
     - Are grounded in real data.
     - Answer the research questions from the study plan.
     - Are easy to understand.
     - Build empathy for users.
     - Inspire direct design action.

### Key Takeaway

Synthesizing data transforms scattered observations into meaningful insights that help the design team **improve the user experience**.  
The next step after this process is **iterating on high-fidelity designs**.

## Iterating on High-Fidelity Designs

### Overview

This is **step four** in the UX research process — **iterating on your designs** based on feedback from usability studies.  
Iteration involves refining mockups or prototypes in Figma to improve the user experience.  
Although updating prototypes is possible, it’s often **time- and cost-intensive**, so UX designers typically start by making updates to **static mockups** first.

### Example Project: Dog Walker App

Two main **insights** from the latest usability study were addressed:

1. **Users struggled to select a date from the calendar.**
2. **Users couldn’t see the price per dog walker until the end of the scheduling flow.**

### Fixing the Date Selection Issue

1. **Identify the problem:**

   - The date picker (scrolling wheel) lacked a weekday view.
   - Users had to check a separate calendar to find specific days (e.g., Mondays).

2. **Design solution:**

   - Replace the wheel with a **calendar pop-up** accessed via a drop-down menu.
   - Create drop-down menus for **Day**, **Time**, and **Duration** fields.
   - Adjust layout spacing to accommodate the new components.

3. **Implementation in Figma:**

   - Duplicate existing screens for new versions.
   - Use the **Material Design** library for icons.
   - Source a **calendar component** from the **Figma Community** instead of building from scratch.
   - Customize colors, fonts, and spacing to match the app’s visual style.

4. **Prototype testing:**
   - Test calendar interaction — ensure smooth drop-down expansion and alignment.
   - Confirm that the new scheduling system works intuitively.

### Fixing the Pricing Transparency Issue

1. **Identify the problem:**

   - Pricing was visible only at the end of the booking process.

2. **Design solution:**

   - Add **price per dog walker** on the homepage beside the **rating** and **distance**.
   - Use consistent spacing and alignment.
   - Example: “$20/hr” for hourly rate based on session pricing.

3. **Implementation in Figma:**
   - Duplicate the homepage.
   - Add **price text and dollar icons** from the Material Design library.
   - Apply consistent color and spacing styles.
   - Copy pricing info to all relevant pages (Browse, Profile).

### Finalizing the Iteration

- **Clean up:** Remove outdated mockups and integrate new screens into the main user flow.
- **Test:** Run the updated prototype from start to finish to verify usability.
- **Outcome:** Improved scheduling flow and clear pricing information enhance the user experience.

### Key Takeaway

Iteration is a continuous process in UX design:

- Gather insights → Refine mockups → Test again.
- Each cycle improves usability and clarity.
  Designers should now **apply feedback from their own usability studies** to update their projects before moving on to stakeholder review or further testing.

## Finalizing and Handing Off Designs

### Overview

After prototyping, testing, gathering feedback, and iterating, designers must decide **when to stop iterating** and **finalize their designs** for handoff to engineering.  
Finalization is a critical step that balances design quality with production readiness.

### When Is a Design “Final”?

Avoid stopping iteration solely because of limited **time or budget** — those factors matter but shouldn’t determine design quality.  
Instead, evaluate your design using three key questions:

1. **True Representation:**  
   Are the designs a complete and accurate reflection of the intended user experience?

2. **Finalized Assets:**  
   Have all placeholder elements — text, icons, and images — been replaced with finalized versions?

3. **Independent Usability:**  
   Can users interact with and understand the design **without external guidance**?

If the answer to all three is **yes**, the design is ready for **handoff to engineering**.

### Designer Mindset

- It’s natural to feel uncertain about stopping iteration — design work can always be improved.
- However, **no product is ever truly finished**; most will evolve through updates after launch.
- Over time, UX designers develop confidence in recognizing when a design is ready for release.

### Key Takeaway

Finalize your design when it:

- Accurately represents the intended experience,
- Uses complete, real assets,
- And is understandable to users independently.

Once these conditions are met, move forward with **engineering handoff**, knowing iteration will continue post-launch as part of the product lifecycle.

## Identifying When a Design Is Complete

### Overview

Determining when a design is truly **complete** can be challenging, especially after multiple iterations.  
To decide whether a design is ready for **handoff to engineering**, evaluate it against key criteria to ensure quality, usability, and consistency.

### Key Questions to Determine Design Completion

Ask yourself the following:

1. **Intended Experience:**  
   Do the designs accurately represent the intended user experience?

2. **Finalized Assets:**  
   Have all placeholder text, icons, and imagery been replaced with finalized assets?

3. **Independent Usability:**  
   Can users interact with and interpret the designs without external help?

4. **Design System Consistency:**  
   Do the designs follow the existing design system?

5. **Platform Conventions:**  
   Do the designs align with common interaction patterns for their respective platforms (e.g., Android, iOS)?

6. **Error Handling:**  
   Do users have a clear and understandable path when something goes wrong?

7. **Accessibility:**  
   Is the design inclusive and accessible to all users?

If you can confidently answer **“yes”** to all of these, your designs are ready to move forward.

### What Completion Means

- The design fulfills the **initial project scope** and addresses the **user problem** it set out to solve.
- Once complete, designs can be **handed off to engineers** for production.

### Continuous Improvement

Even after handoff or launch:

- Expect to **iterate** based on real-world user feedback.
- Recognize that **no design is ever fully done** — improvements and updates are part of ongoing UX practice.
- Experience helps designers feel more confident in recognizing when a design is polished enough for production.

## Handoff to Engineering

### Overview

After completing your **high-fidelity prototype**, the next major step is the **design handoff** — transferring your finalized designs to engineers for production.  
While most specs are already embedded in **Figma**, designers may still need to document **edge cases** and **accessibility details** to ensure a smooth transition.

### Common Handoff Scenarios

#### 1. **Relay-Style Handoff (Typical in Small Teams or Agencies)**

- Designers complete all design details before passing work to engineers.
- Once handed off, designers usually move on to other projects.
- Works like a **relay race** — one team finishes their “lap” before the next begins.

#### 2. **Collaborative Handoff (Typical in Large Companies like Google)**

- Designers and engineers **work simultaneously** on different parts of the product.
- Example:
  - Engineers may start on the **user profile** or **shopping cart**.
  - Designers continue refining the **homepage** or **navigation**.
- **Advantages:** Faster progress.
- **Risks:** Some rework may be required if overlapping changes occur.

### Best Practices for Entry-Level UX Designers

- You may not decide the handoff process, but you’ll be **actively involved** in it.
- **Build strong relationships** with cross-functional teammates (engineers, PMs, QA) to ensure a smooth workflow.
- Stay organized and document clearly — include specs, interactions, and accessibility notes.

### Technical Logistics

- Figma simplifies collaboration by providing:
  - Design specs (colors, dimensions, spacing)
  - Interactive prototypes
  - Shared files for engineers
- A Figma demo video follows this lesson to show **how to collaborate effectively during handoff**.

### Key Takeaway

There’s **no single correct way** to hand off designs — it depends on team size, workflow, and company structure.  
Whether sequential or collaborative, successful handoff requires **clear communication, thorough documentation,** and **team alignment.**

## Collaboration and Handoff in Figma
