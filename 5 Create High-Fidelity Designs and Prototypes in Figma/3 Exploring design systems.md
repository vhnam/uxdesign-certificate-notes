## What is a Design System

### Definitions

- **Design system**: A collection of reusable elements and guidelines that help teams design and develop products following predefined standards.
- **Brand guidelines**: Rules on logo, color usage, and typography.
- **Components**: UI parts like buttons, icons, and forms.
- **Color palettes**: Defines brand and functional colors.
- **Visual elements**: Include color, iconography, layout, copy, animation, elevation, typography, and illustration.

### Purpose

- Ensures consistency across branding, components, and processes.
- Centralizes various design and process guidelines in one place.
- Simplifies maintaining consistency across products and teams.
- Improves scalability and communication between designers and developers.

## Design System Structure

### Core Sections

1. **Visual Styles**

   - Define core visual design elements such as typography, color palettes, and iconography.
   - Express the brand consistently and improve the user experience.
   - Example: Google includes hex codes for blue, red, yellow, and green in its design system to ensure consistent brand colors.

2. **Guidelines**

   - Include design principles, editorial guidelines, and implementation rules.
   - Provide clear rules for applying styles and components consistently across products.

3. **UI Components**

   - Reusable interface elements and features shared across a product or brand (e.g., buttons, dialogs, gestures).
   - Form the foundation for consistent visual and functional design.

4. **Supporting Code**
   - Provides ready-to-use code snippets or component libraries for developers.
   - Ensures that visual designs translate correctly into working products.

### UI Pattern Hierarchy

- **Elements**: Smallest visual units like text, color, and icons.
- **Components**: Combinations of elements (e.g., button, form field).
- **Modules**: Groups of components (e.g., header, navigation bar).
- **Templates**: Collections of modules forming complete pages.

## Benefits of Design Systems

### Consistency

- Enforces uniformity in visual and interactive elements.
- Makes it easier for designers to follow standards and for users to recognize interface patterns.
- Example: Dog walker app defines buttons as orange (#FA7B17) with rounded edges and SF Pro Display font.

### Brand Identity

- Reinforces a company’s brand across all digital products.
- Example: Google Material uses four signature colors (blue, red, yellow, green), Google Sans font, and rounded corners across all Google apps.

### Scalability

- Maintains performance and visual quality as teams and products grow.
- Simplifies onboarding new designers and speeds up design iteration.

### Efficiency and Cost Savings

- Streamlines workflows with predefined standards and reusable components.
- Reduces repetitive design decisions, saving both time and resources.

### Collaboration

- Aligns designers and developers through shared standards and reusable component code.
- Reduces friction during design handoffs and ensures smoother implementation.

## Working with Design Systems

### By Company Size

- **Large companies**: Typically have established design systems (e.g., Google Material). Designers follow existing standards.
- **Small companies/startups**: Designers may help build a new system — a challenge and valuable learning opportunity.

### Contribution Examples

- Updating colors, typography, components, or templates in the style guide.
- Documenting usage guidelines and accessibility standards.

## Design System Libraries

## Sticker Sheets (Design Kits)

### Definitions

- **Sticker sheets / Design kits**: Collections of reusable design elements and components forming part of a design system.
- **Purpose**: Maintain consistency, simplify collaboration, and reduce rework.

### Structure

- Contain commonly used **elements** (colors, icons, nav bars) and **components** (buttons, dropdowns).
- Serve as a **visual library** that can be reused across projects.

### In Figma

- **Component**: Main version of a reusable design object.
- **Instance**: Copy of the component that updates automatically when the original changes.
- Updating the base component propagates to all instances.

### How to Create a Sticker Sheet

1. Create a blank frame.
2. Add frequently used UI elements (buttons, chips, dropdowns, profile cards).
3. Show visual states (active, hover, pressed, disabled).

Example: White version (inactive) vs. orange version (active) of a reviews icon.

### Benefits

- Promotes visual and behavioral consistency.
- Enables faster collaboration.
- Simplifies onboarding and iteration.
- Prevents inconsistencies (e.g., corner shapes, spacing).

## Using Components from Existing Design Systems in Mockups

### Overview

- Purpose: Use **elements and components** from public systems like Material or Fluent to build mockups efficiently.
- Typical in UX roles — ensures speed, scalability, and brand alignment.

### Incorporating Design Systems

- Reuse components and customize typography, color, or spacing.
- Combine custom elements with existing system components for flexibility.

## Material Design System in Figma

### Getting Started

1. Open the **Material Design UI Kit** in Figma.
2. Navigate to the **Material Theme** page — includes styles for typography, color, elevation, and states.

### Key Concepts

#### Elevation

- Visual depth and hierarchy in UI layers.
- Example:
  - Screen background: elevation 0
  - Buttons: elevation 4
  - Alerts: higher elevation for prominence

#### States

- Represent interactive feedback (e.g., pressed, hover, disabled).
- **Ripple overlay**: Material’s signature feedback effect for touch interactions.

## Best Practices and Takeaways

- Design systems save time and ensure cohesive, user-friendly interfaces.
- Explore multiple systems (Material, Fluent, Human Interface, Polaris).
- Customize responsibly — maintain structure, adjust for brand.
- Practice improves both speed and polish.

## Get Inspiration from Design Systems

### Importance of Visual Consistency

- Design systems create a recognizable and cohesive brand identity.
- Example: Everyday consumer products use consistent colors, fonts, and icons for brand recall.

### Example: Artniche (Arts Magazine)

- Applies consistent typography, color palette, and button design across app and website for visual harmony.

### Principle

- The number of elements depends on the product’s goals.
- Goal: Strengthen brand consistency, streamline collaboration, and improve design quality.

## Real-World Design System Examples

- **Google Material Design**
- **Shopify Polaris**
- **Microsoft Fluent**
- **Salesforce Lightning**
- **Atlassian Design System**
- **Uber Base Web**

### Accessing Design Systems in Figma

1. Visit **Figma Community**.
2. Search for brand design systems.

## Showcasing a Design System in Your Portfolio

### Example

- **Google UX Designer Dane** showcased his app “Pocket,” highlighting typography, iconography, and buttons.
- Demonstrates understanding of visual systems and design rationale.

### Best Practices

- Document fonts, colors, icons, and component choices.
- Even minimal systems show process and consistency.
- Adds professional depth to your portfolio.

## Designing for Accessibility — Insights from Shabi (Interaction Designer at Google)

### Role and Focus

- Shabi works in Google’s **Design Systems** team, focusing on accessibility in components.
- Ensures interactive elements like buttons and inputs are usable by all users.

### Assistive Technologies

- **Assistive technology (AT)**: Helps users with disabilities interact with interfaces.
- Example: Screen readers announce element roles (“Cancel button”).

### Inclusive Design Approach

- Engage with people who have disabilities for authentic feedback.
- Visit local communities and accessibility organizations to understand real needs.
- Design _with_ users, not just _for_ them.

### Challenges

- Accessibility is often added late instead of being designed upfront.
- Inclusive design should be integrated from the beginning.

### Core Principle

- Designing inclusively benefits all users, improving overall usability and equity.
- Accessibility-first design leads to better, more human-centered products.
