## What is a design system

### Definitions

- Design system: A collection of reusable elements and guidelines that help teams design and develop products following predefined standards.
- Brand guidelines: Rules on logo, color usage, and typography.
- Components: UI parts like buttons, icons, and forms.
- Color palettes: Defines brand and functional colors.
- Visual elements: Include color, iconography, layout, copy, animation, elevation, typography, and illustration.

### Purpose

- Ensures consistency across branding, components, and processes.
- Centralizes various design and process guidelines in one place.
- Simplifies maintaining consistency across products and teams.

## Design system structure

### Core sections

1. Visual styles: Define core visual design elements (typography, colors, iconography). Expresses the brand consistently and improves user experience.
2. Guidelines: Include design principles, editorial, and implementation rules. Help designers stay consistent when applying components and styles.
3. UI patterns: From smallest to largest - elements, components, modules, templates. Each section includes usage notes and priority.
4. Supporting code: Provides ready-to-use code snippets for developers. Ensures visual consistency carries through to implementation.

### UI pattern hierarchy

- Elements: Smallest visual units like text, color, and icons.
- Components: Combinations of elements (e.g. button, form label).
- Modules: Groups of components (e.g. header, navigation bar).
- Templates: Collections of modules forming full pages.

## Benefits of design systems

### Consistency

- Enforces uniformity in visual and interaction elements.
- Makes it easier for designers to follow standards and users to recognize interface patterns.
- Example: Dog walker app defines buttons as orange (#FA7B17) with rounded edges and SF Pro Display font.

### Brand identity

- Reinforces a company's brand across multiple products.
- Example: Google Material uses four signature colors (blue, red, yellow, green), Google Sans font, and rounded corners across all Google apps.

### Understanding Assistive Technologies

- **Assistive technology (AT)**: Enhances accessibility by enabling interaction between users and interfaces.
- Example: **Screen readers** assist users with limited vision by:
  - Reading on-screen text and content aloud.
  - Announcing roles of interactive elements (e.g., _“Cancel button”_).
- Designers must understand how AT interacts with UI elements to create inclusive interfaces.

### Approach to Inclusive Design

- Engage directly with **people who have disabilities** to understand their needs.
- Explore **local communities** and **independent living facilities** for real user insights.
- Building empathy and firsthand understanding is key to designing meaningful, accessible products.

### Common Challenges

- Accessibility is often treated as an **afterthought** or **“patchwork” solution** during late development stages.
- True accessibility should be integrated **from the beginning** of the design process.

### Core Principle

- Designing **with** people with disabilities (not just **for** them) leads to better, more **inclusive** and **equitable experiences** for all users.
- Accessibility-first design extends benefits to a wider audience and improves overall usability.
