Mockups include real content and offer flexibility in layout adjustments. The goal is to create designs that are visually appealing, functional, and accessible.

Mockup serves not only as a design reference but also as a communication tool for engineering and product teams. These mockups help align the team on what the final product will look like and whether it solves the intended problem.

Foundational elements of visual design: typography, color, and iconography.

- **Typography** involves the use of text to create hierarchy, readability, and style.
- **Color** communicates meaning and mood, with tools like the color wheel helping designers choose harmonious combinations.
- **Iconography** refers to recognizable symbols, like the power icon.

## Typography

1. Type classification: General system, e.g. serif & sans-serif
2. Picking a typeface: Overall style of a letter, e.g. Times New Roman
3. Choosing a font: Size, thickness, emphasis of letters, e.g. Times New Roman Bold, 18 pt

Typography improves both hierarchy and legibility:

- A typographic hierarchy is a method of ordering typefaces and fonts in a layout consistently to help users better navigate a page.
- Legibility ensures that text is easy to read, especially for users with low vision, such as using bold, high-contrast fonts for clarity (like on food labels or checkout pages).

### Add product copy to mockups

### Placeholder Text

- Useful in early stages (e.g., wireframes) to focus on layout without needing finalized content.
- Speeds up design and allows collaboration before the copy is ready.
- Downsides: Can confuse stakeholders, affect layout when replaced, and shift attention away from design.

### Real Copy

- Helps create a more authentic, cohesive experience by showing real content and structure.
- Encourages earlier feedback on content-related decisions.
- Downsides: May require frequent changes, and can distract from core design discussions in early stages.

### Best Practice

- Use placeholder text for low-fidelity designs and real copy for high-fidelity designs.
- A mix of both can be effective—e.g., real labels for nav buttons but placeholder text for content.
- Choose based on the project needs, stakeholder preferences, and stage of the design process.

**Key takeaway:** Be flexible—adapt your use of copy to best support communication, clarity, and usability in your design.

## Color

### Importance of Color in UX Design

Color influences user behavior, mood, and perception. It can:

- Convey emotions (e.g., red = urgency, blue = calm)
- Signal actions
- Enhance branding
- Affect accessibility

### Color for Emphasis

Color highlights important actions (e.g., buttons).

The 60-30-10 Rule is commonly used:

- 60% neutral color (e.g., white)
- 30% complementary color (e.g., gray)
- 10% accent color (e.g., orange for a CTA button)

### Color for Branding

- Color defines a product's visual identity.
- Strong brands use consistent color palettes (e.g., Google’s blue, red, yellow, green).
- Designers must follow brand color guidelines to maintain consistency.

### Color and Accessibility

- High contrast improves readability for all users.
- Follow [WCAG](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/) guidelines to ensure accessible design.
- Test colors across devices and lighting conditions—colors can appear differently depending on the environment (e.g., the viral “dress” illusion).

### Key Takeaway

Use color purposefully to emphasize, communicate brand identity, and support accessibility—all to help users navigate your product more effectively.

### Accessibility Considerations for Color

- Color affects emotions and draws attention, but designers must ensure colors work for all users, including those with visual impairments like color blindness.
- The WCAG guidelines provide standards to improve accessibility, covering disabilities such as visual, auditory, physical, cognitive, and neurological.

### Color Blindness

- Common types include red-green, blue-yellow, and total color blindness.
- To accommodate color blindness:
  - Use icons or symbols alongside color (e.g., an exclamation mark with a red highlight).
  - Use patterns or textures in addition to color to differentiate elements (like in graphs).
  - Avoid difficult-to-distinguish color pairs placed next to each other (e.g., green & red, blue & purple).
  - Always provide multiple ways to convey information, not just color.

### Low Contrast Sensitivity

- Many people struggle with distinguishing low-contrast elements, especially in poor lighting or with aging eyes.
- WCAG recommends a minimum contrast ratio of 4.5:1 between text and background to ensure readability.
- Contrast ratios range from low (2:1) to maximum (21:1, black and white).
- Tools like WebAIM’s Contrast Checker help test and adjust colors to meet accessibility standards.

### Light Sensitivity

- Some users are sensitive to bright light and prefer light, dark, or high contrast modes.
- Designers should support multiple display modes to accommodate these preferences.

### Tools & Tips

- Use simulators like [Color Blindness Simulator](https://www.color-blindness.com/coblis-color-blindness-simulator/) to test your designs.
- Use plugins like [Stark](https://www.figma.com/community/plugin/732603254453395948/stark-contrast-accessibility-checker) for Figma to check contrast directly in design software.
- Explore [Color Safe](http://colorsafe.co/) for generating accessible color palettes.

## Iconography

- Icons are graphic symbols that represent ideas or actions, helping users navigate and understand interfaces quickly.

### Universal vs. Cultural Icons

- Some icons (like a house for “Home”) are widely recognized.
- Others (like American football) may not work globally—choose culturally relevant icons.

### Accessibility

Always add text labels to icons so screen readers can interpret them.

### Best Practices for Using Icons

- Make icons universal: Choose icons understandable by a global audience.
- Include text labels: Add small labels below icons to improve accessibility and clarity.
- Keep branding consistent: Match icons’ color, style, and font to the overall design.

### More Visual Design Elements

Beyond typography, color, and iconography, key basic visual elements include lines, size, shape, and images. You don't need to be artistic to use these effectively.

- Lines: Connect or separate sections, emphasize parts of a design (e.g., a line under headers).
- Size: Relative size matters, especially on small screens—too small buttons frustrate users.
- Shape: Shapes (circles, squares, etc.) convey meaning, like a circle with "+" to expand or "X" to close.
- Images: Tell stories and add impact; should be relevant and emotionally engaging for users.

### Putting It All Together

- Visual appeal: Check your design for clarity, proper alignment, and aesthetic balance.
- Accessibility: Make sure elements like headers stand out, and images have alternative text for screen readers.

## Images

- Images help communicate messages without words and aid user scanning.
- Photos (e.g., hotel rooms) show details words can’t.
- Images create emotional connections and add personality (e.g., Twitter’s “Fail Whale”).
- Strong images help differentiate a product and build brand presence.
- Use images purposefully to support text and UI, not just decoration.

## Additional Design Considerations

### Hyperlinked Text

- Hyperlinks help users navigate and are usually blue and underlined.
- Use links sparingly to avoid clutter.
- Follow conventions: blue + underlined = link.
- Links don’t have to look the same—logos often link to home.
- Use descriptive link text instead of generic words like "here."

### Buttons

- Buttons should look clickable (common shapes: rectangles, circles).
- Use consistent button styles throughout your design.
- Include padding/negative space around buttons for easier clicking/tapping.
- Common button types: filled (square/rounded), with shadow, or outlined (“ghost” buttons).

### Inputs

- Inputs are fields for user info and should be clear and appropriately sized.
- Use visual cues like ghost/hint text to show expected input format.
- Group inputs into categories (e.g., Personal Info, Contact Info) for clarity when many fields are present.

## Layouts

- Layouts arrange text, style, icons, and images on a page.
- The purpose is to present information logically and highlight key elements.

### Using Grids in Layouts

Grids help place elements accurately and improve user flow in mockups.

- Basic grids divide pages into evenly spaced squares for consistent spacing.
- Layout grids use columns (colored blocks) and alleys (spaces) to organize content.

Number of columns varies by device:

- Websites: ~12 columns
- Tablets/apps: 4–8 columns
- Smartwatches: 1 column

Why use a layout grid?

- Create clarity and consistency
- Quicken the design process
- Make it easier to collaborate on designs

Grids also make layouts reusable for different purposes.

### Containment

Containment helps organize design layouts using visual barriers like **lines and colors**. There are four main methods:

- **Dividers** – Lines that separate unrelated content (e.g., gray lines between dog walker profiles).
- **Borders** – Continuous lines forming shapes (e.g., a rectangle around a button to make it identifiable).
- **Fill** – Adds color to shapes or borders to draw attention (e.g., applying orange fill to highlight a button).
- **Shadow** – Adds depth and dimension, often combined with borders or fill (e.g., making a button appear three-dimensional).

## Spacing (White Space) in UX Design

White space—also called negative space—is the empty space between elements in a design. It's a powerful tool that improves layout, usability, and clarity. There are three main benefits of white space:

- **Emphasis:** White space draws attention to key elements, like a call-to-action button. For example, the Google homepage uses white space to focus attention on the search bar.
- **Proximity (Grouping):** Elements placed close together are perceived as related, while distant elements seem unrelated—this is based on the Gestalt principle of proximity.
- **Readability:** Adequate spacing makes designs easier to read and navigate. Overcrowded layouts confuse users and reduce usability.

Additionally, insufficient white space can lead to errors, such as accidentally tapping the wrong button on a mobile app.

Finally, as a UX designer, you may need to educate stakeholders on the value of white space. Though some may want to cram more content in, well-used spacing can enhance usability and drive better results—like more sign-ups or conversions.

### Why Negative Space Matters

- **Indicates Relationships:** Elements placed close together are seen as related due to the Gestalt Principle of proximity. Negative space helps distinguish between related and unrelated elements.
- **Draws Attention:** Negative space helps users focus on important elements, like buttons or key actions. Without it, users can quickly lose focus.
- **Provides a Visual Break:** It prevents the design from feeling overcrowded, giving users a mental break as they scan the page.
- **Increases Readability:** Proper use of negative space makes text easier to read and helps avoid overwhelming users with too much information at once.

### How to Use Negative Space in Your Designs

- **Line Spacing**: Vertical space between text to make reading easier.
- **Padding**: Space around content, inside borders, preventing overcrowding and creating balance.
- **Margins**: The space outside the design's border, helping keep elements within a clean layout.

## Common design patterns in mobile apps

When designing mobile app layouts, it’s useful to know common design patterns used in existing apps. This can streamline your design process and improve usability.

### Common App Screens

1. Home Screen

- The first screen users see, displaying the app’s main content and features.
- It should be simple, easy to navigate, and not overcrowded with content.
- Familiar navigation elements like a bottom menu and search icon are commonly used.

2. Onboarding Screens

- Introduce new users to the app’s features and functions.
- These screens help users get started quickly and can personalize the experience.
- Clear, concise copy and engaging visuals are key to reducing user drop-off.

3. Profile/Account Screen

- Contains personal details, preferences, and settings.
- Should be simple, clean, and organized to make navigation easy.

4. Checkout Screen

- Used for completing purchases and can involve filling out payment and shipping details.
- To minimize stress, ensure forms are easy to fill out with visual cues and security assurances.

### Key Takeaways

- Incorporating common design patterns into your wireframes makes the design process smoother, saving time for creative experimentation.
- Other design patterns to explore include splash screens, navigation drawers, and floating action buttons.
