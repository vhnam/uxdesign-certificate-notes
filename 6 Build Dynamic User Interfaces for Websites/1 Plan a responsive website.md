## Common Website Structures

### Overview

- Site structures organize website content to help users navigate efficiently.
- Four main models:
  - Hierarchical
  - Sequential
  - Matrix
  - Database

### Hierarchical Structure

- **Definition:** A top-down model with broad parent categories leading to detailed child pages (like a family tree).
- **Example:** HBO.com → Parent: _Series, Movies, Docs_ → Child: _Featured Series, Sports_.
- **Benefits:** Clear organization, intuitive navigation, and easy content prioritization.

### Sequential Structure

- **Definition:** A linear, step-by-step model guiding users through a process.
- **Example:** Insurance websites leading users through quote forms.
- **Features:** Users move between “next” and “previous” pages only.
- **Goal:** Move users toward an end action or result.

### Matrix Structure

- **Definition:** Allows users to follow their own path since pages are interlinked in multiple ways.
- **Example:** News websites with articles linking to related stories or categories.
- **Pros:** Encourages exploration and discovery.
- **Cons:** Can be confusing if users don’t know what they’re looking for (sometimes considered outdated).

### Database Structure

- **Definition:** Combines a database with search functionality for dynamic, filterable experiences.
- **Examples:** Social media platforms (search by tags, locations) and Google Maps (search by address or category).
- **Strengths:** Advanced filtering, search capabilities, and dynamic content generation.

### Advantages of Using Structure Models

- Meet user expectations through familiar patterns.

## Creating a Sitemap

### Purpose

- A **sitemap** visually represents how all pages on a website connect and are organized.
- It helps ensure a clear navigation flow that supports both user goals and business needs.
- Building a sitemap early in the design process allows designers to identify missing or redundant pages before development begins.

### Step 1: Identify Common Website Pages

- Most websites include pages such as:
  - Homepage
  - Product or content detail pages
  - Shopping cart or checkout pages
  - User account pages
  - About or information sections
- Look for **common pages** during your **competitive audit** — shared elements across competitor websites reveal user expectations.
  - Example: Library websites often include a **search results** page listing books.

### Step 2: Focus on User Needs

- Use findings from **empathy maps, personas, user stories, and user journey maps**.
- Ensure the sitemap reflects the actions users take to meet their goals.
  - Example (Library user “Shane”):
    1. Browse the catalog
    2. Choose a book
    3. Reserve or join a waitlist
    4. Pick up the book at the library

### Step 3: Choose a Website Structure

- Select a structure that best fits the project:
  - **Hierarchical**
  - **Sequential**
  - **Matrix**
  - **Database**
- It’s common to **combine multiple structures** depending on content needs.
- Example: The **library website** uses a **hierarchical structure** — homepage at the top, categories branching below.

### Step 4: Build the Sitemap

1. **Start with the homepage** at the top (main access point).
2. **Add main categories** (parent pages), usually matching the navigation bar items:
   - Books
   - Checkout cart
   - User account
   - About
3. **Add subcategories** (child pages) under each category:
   - Under **Books** → Recent releases, Most popular, Recommendations
4. Adjust, condense, or reorganize pages as needed.

### Step 5: Refine and Review

- A **well-defined sitemap** helps:
  - Visualize the full structure before design begins.
  - Improve site navigation and user orientation.
  - Identify missing or redundant content early.
  - Save **time and money** during development.

### Key Takeaway

## Common Website Layouts and Best Practices

### Overview

- **Homepages** are the main entry point for users and serve as the central hub for navigation.
- Choosing the right **layout** improves usability, accessibility, and overall user experience.
- There are multiple common layout types, each serving different purposes and user needs.

### Single-Column Layout

- **Definition:**  
  Content is arranged in one vertical column — simple and linear.
- **Use Case:**  
  Common for **blogs** or **mobile websites**.
- **Structure:**  
  Navigation at the top → content in the middle → footer at the bottom.
- **Benefit:**  
  Clean, easy to read, ideal for mobile or content-focused designs.

### Multi-Column Layout

- **Definition:**  
  Two or more columns divide the page into distinct content sections.
- **Focal Point:**  
  One area (often an image) draws the most attention; supporting content takes 25–45% of the space.
- **Examples:**
  - **Two-column:** Grow with Google website (image + supporting text).
  - **Three-column:** Recipe sites showing more items “above the fold.”
- **Use Case:**  
  Best for **desktop layouts** or **content-rich pages**.

### Box Layout

- **Definition:**  
  Uses boxes or squares to organize content by category or topic.
- **Example:**  
  Nordstrom’s homepage organizes seasonal gift categories in boxes.
- **Use Case:**  
  Common in **e-commerce** and **UX portfolios**.
- **Benefit:**  
  Flexible for swapping seasonal or promotional content.

### Featured Image (Single Image) Layout

- **Definition:**  
  Focuses on a single large image or video as the centerpiece of the page.
- **Purpose:**  
  Creates a strong visual impact and emotional connection.
- **Features:**
  - High-quality visuals
  - Often includes a **sticky menu bar**
- **Example:**  
  Caledon Build homepage.
- **Use Case:**  
  Great for **product pages** or **brand storytelling**.

### Asymmetrical Layouts

- **Definition:**  
  Uses purposeful imbalance to emphasize certain elements like images or headlines.
- **Types:**
  - **F-shape layout:** Users scan in an F pattern; ideal for **content-heavy pages** (e.g., search results).
  - **Z-shape layout:** Users scan left → right → diagonal → right again; suits **simpler, visual designs**.
- **Accessibility:**  
  Users with assistive technology still follow similar scanning patterns.

### Grid of Cards Layout

- **Definition:**  
  Displays content previews in uniform or variable-sized cards arranged in a grid.
- **Examples:**  
  Dribbble, YouTube, Pinterest, recipe sites.
- **Benefit:**  
  Scales easily for different screen sizes; ideal for **content-heavy** or **media-rich** sites.

### Tiered Layer Cake Layout

- **Definition:**  
  Stacked horizontal layers, like tiers of a cake; each row can have a different number of columns.
- **Example:**  
  Strider Bikes website — distinct layers with text, icons, and images.
- **Use Case:**  
  Excellent for **responsive design**, as layers can be rearranged easily.
- **Difference from Multi-Column Layout:**  
  No overarching container or sidebar; each layer stands on its own.

### Key Takeaways

- **Familiar layouts** help users navigate quickly because they’ve seen similar structures elsewhere.
- Always choose a **layout based on user needs**, not trends.
- The most effective layout:

  - Supports usability and accessibility.
  - Fits the project’s content and goals.
  - Adapts well to different devices and screen sizes.

  ## Wireframing: Designing Page Layouts

### Definition

- **Wireframe:**  
  A simple, low-fidelity **outline or sketch** of a webpage or screen used to plan layout and functionality.
  - Focuses on structure, not visuals.
  - Uses shapes, lines, and minimal text to represent content and features.

### Purpose

- Helps designers **determine page layout** and user flow.
- Acts as a **blueprint** showing how elements relate and how users will navigate between screens.
- Encourages rapid **iteration and experimentation** before moving to high-fidelity design.

### Methods of Wireframing

1. **Paper Wireframes:**

   - Fast and flexible for brainstorming multiple ideas.
   - Common conventions:
     - Text → horizontal lines
     - Images/icons → boxes with an “X”
     - Buttons → rectangles or circles

2. **Digital Wireframes:**
   - Created later for refinement and sharing.
   - Useful for collaboration and version control.

   - Account/cart icons
   - Hero image with descriptive text
   - Sections for featured books and new releases
   - Footer (social media, terms, careers, privacy policy, logo)

2. **Design the layout (top-to-bottom):**

   - **Header:** Logo, navigation, hero image with text
   - **Above the fold:** Featured books in two rectangles with text
   - **Below the fold:** Additional books in grouped sections
   - **Footer:** Links, logo, and legal info

3. **Create multiple variations (at least five):**
   - **Option A:** Large hero image with text
   - **Option B:** Prominent search bar at top right
   - **Option C:** Floating navigation box
   - **Option D:** Simplified homepage combining sections like Discover, About, Donate
   - **Option E:** Search-centered “search engine” style homepage

### Evaluation and Iteration

- Review all wireframes **side by side** to compare ideas.
- **Star favorite elements** to combine later:
  - Option E: Tabs for Discover, About, Donate
  - Option A: Large hero image with text
  - Option D: Discover section for popular books
  - Option B: Well-designed footer with logo and links
- Combine starred elements into a **refined hybrid wireframe**.

### Key Takeaways

- **Create multiple wireframes** to explore different ideas and layouts.
- **Combine the best features** from multiple drafts into one optimized design.
- **Paper wireframes** are ideal for fast ideation and collaboration.

## Accessibility in Digital Wireframes

### Overview

- Accessibility ensures **users of all abilities, identities, and experiences** can navigate and interact with your design successfully.
- UX designers must plan for **assistive technology** users from the wireframing stage onward.
- Three key accessibility features to include in wireframes are **headings**, **landmarks**, and **initial focus**.

### 1. Headings

- **Definition:**  
  Titles or subtitles that identify sections of a webpage (e.g., page titles, menu labels, or content blocks).
- **Purpose:**
  - Support **visual hierarchy** for sighted users.
  - Enable **screen readers** to navigate efficiently.
  - Users can skip directly to desired sections via a “headings menu.”
- **Best Practices:**
  - Use consistent heading levels (H1, H2, H3) to structure content logically.
  - Annotate heading levels in wireframes for developers.
  - Example (Library website):
    - “Featured Author” → H2
    - “Popular at WCL” → H2
    - “Featured Collections” → H2

### 2. Landmarks

- **Definition:**  
  Distinct, navigable regions of a webpage that guide users — similar to real-world landmarks.
- **Examples:**  
  Navigation bars, search boxes, sidebars, and footers.
- **Purpose:**
  - Help assistive technologies like **screen readers** identify and jump between key sections.
  - Provide **orientation cues** for users moving through the site.
- **Example:**  
  iOS’s VoiceOver uses a **rotor tool (Ctrl + Option + U)** to let users browse by landmarks or headings.

### 3. Initial Focus

- **Definition:**  
  The first element designed to draw a user’s attention or interaction when a page loads.
- **Purpose:**
  - Directs users to the **primary task or goal** (e.g., a search bar or key CTA).
  - Reduces **cognitive overload** by clarifying what to do first.
- **Example:**  
  On the **Google homepage**, the search bar is centered and set as the initial focus to highlight its importance.
- **Best Practices:**
  - Keep interfaces uncluttered.
  - Use focus to emphasize key tasks or next steps.

### Key Takeaways

- **Headings** → Organize content and support navigation.
- **Landmarks** → Help users orient themselves across sections.
- **Initial focus** → Guides users toward primary actions.
- Incorporating these accessibility features early in **digital wireframes** ensures your design is inclusive, user-friendly, and ready for development.

## Applying Gestalt Principles in Digital Wireframes

### Overview

- **Gestalt Principles** explain how humans naturally group, recognize, and simplify visual information.
- In UX design, these principles help organize content so interfaces feel **cohesive, intuitive, and easy to understand**.
- People tend to perceive the **whole before the parts**, mentally connecting separate elements into meaningful patterns.

### Key Gestalt Principles for Wireframing

#### 1. Similarity

- **Definition:**  
  Elements that look alike (in **shape, size, or color**) are perceived to have the same function.
- **Application Example (Library Website):**
  - In the “Popular at WCL” section, identical rectangles and text groups for book listings signal that they serve the same purpose.
  - Users instantly recognize consistent patterns — such as identical layouts for book covers and titles — improving comprehension.
- **Design Impact:**  
  Creates **visual consistency** and helps users quickly identify recurring elements and functions.

#### 2. Proximity

- **Definition:**  
  Elements placed close together are perceived as **related**, while those spaced apart seem **unrelated**.
- **Application Example:**
  - Under “Featured Collections,” groups of three rectangles placed close together indicate they belong to the same collection.
  - A gap between groups signals that they represent different categories.
- **Design Impact:**  
  Supports **logical grouping** and clarifies relationships between pieces of content.

#### 3. Common Region

- **Definition:**  
  Elements enclosed within a shared boundary or background are seen as **part of one group**.
- **Application Example:**
  - The “Featured Author” section includes a header, title, and descriptive text all inside a bordered box.
  - The shared border communicates that the elements belong together and refer to the same topic.
- **Design Impact:**  
  Enhances **organization** and **visual grouping** by defining clear regions for related content.

### Key Takeaways

- Gestalt Principles help create **visual hierarchy** and **meaningful relationships** between elements in wireframes.
- Applying **similarity**, **proximity**, and **common region** makes layouts more intuitive and user-friendly.
- As you refine your wireframes:
  - Move related elements closer together (proximity).
  - Make similar items visually consistent (similarity).
  - Group connected elements within shared boundaries (common region).
- These principles guide users naturally through your design — improving clarity, comprehension, and overall experience.
