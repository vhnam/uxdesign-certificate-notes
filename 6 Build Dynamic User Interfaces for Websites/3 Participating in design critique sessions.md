## Design Handoff and Collaboration

### The Handoff Process

- After completing a **high-fidelity prototype**, designers must share their work with developers.
- Handoff includes:
  - Mockups
  - Prototypes
  - Specifications
- Developers use these materials to turn designs into **functional, usable products**.

### Developer Roles

#### Front-End Developers

- Write code for **user-facing interfaces**.
- Implement functionality that users **interact with directly**.
- Follow UX designer specifications to bring the visual and interactive aspects to life.

#### Back-End Developers

- Handle **website architecture, data storage, and retrieval**.
- Work from the **UX sitemap** and intended functionality.
- Ensure performance — e.g., **fast-loading sites** depend on strong backend engineering.

### Determining Final Designs

Ask before handoff:

1. Are designs a **true representation** of the intended user experience?
2. Have **placeholder assets** (text, icons, images) been replaced with finalized ones?
3. Can users **interact with and interpret** the design without extra explanation?

If yes → The design is finalized and ready for production.

### Collaboration in Real-World Teams

- Designers collaborate with both front-end and back-end developers.
- **Strong communication** is essential for success.
- Every team may follow different **methodologies**, and there’s **no single “right” way** — focus on what works best collectively.

## UX Portfolios and Case Studies

### Importance of Portfolios

- Portfolios are the **main tool** UX designers use to showcase their work to recruiters and hiring managers.
- They demonstrate a designer’s **skills, process, and growth** through completed projects.

### Role of Case Studies

- **Case studies** are the core of a UX portfolio.
- Each design project should have its **own case study**.
- A case study presents:
  - Project goals and objectives
  - Designer’s role
  - Team process
  - Final outcomes

### Why Case Studies Matter

- Show **design knowledge** and **problem-solving ability**.
- Reflect **collaboration skills** and **perseverance** through challenges.
- Help recruiters **evaluate real-world experience**.

### Key Elements of a Case Study

- Your role in the project
- Project goals and objectives
- Target users
- Research conducted and key findings
- Sketches and wireframes
- Final polished designs
- Key challenges or constraints
- Lessons learned during the process

### Presentation Tips

- Keep it **concise**, **visually appealing**, and **easy to skim**.
- Tell a **clear, engaging story** of the design journey.
- Once completed, add the **responsive website project** as the next piece in your portfolio.

## Giving and Receiving Feedback in UX Design

- Reviewers liked the rounded button style but raised concerns about:
  - **Overuse of orange** across UI elements.
  - Possible **accessibility issues** (color contrast).
  - Suggested toning down icon colors (e.g., gray instead of orange for step indicators).
- Kunal explained the orange color followed the **design system** and promised to verify **contrast accessibility**.

#### **Button Placement and Consistency**

- Reviewers noted slight **size and position changes** of CTA buttons across screens.
- Asked if this inconsistency could distract users.
- Kunal explained buttons were scaled proportionally to maintain visual balance.

### Facilitator’s Role (Michael)

- Opened the session by introducing participants and guidelines.
- Managed turn-taking and transitions between topics (scheduling flow → CTA buttons).
- Ensured all feedback aligned with the **objectives** of the critique.

### Key Takeaways

- **Presenter:** Clearly explained design rationale and listened thoughtfully to feedback.

## After a Design Critique Session

### Purpose

After a critique session, the **presenter’s goal** is to:

- **Review and process feedback** from reviewers.
- **Decide which suggestions to act on**.
- **Generate clear action items** for improving the design.

### Steps for Processing Feedback

1. **Review Notes**

   - Go through notes taken during the session (either by yourself or a notetaker).
   - Reflect on each piece of feedback to determine its value and relevance.

2. **Synthesize Feedback**

   - If there are multiple reviewers, identify **themes and recurring insights**.
   - Fewer reviewers mean less synthesis but the same careful review process.

3. **Evaluate Each Feedback Item**

   - **Example 1 – Copy suggestion (Shabi):**

     - Suggested rewording “Who is going for a walk?”
     - Not tied to design principles or user experience impact → _Nice to have_, no action needed.

   - **Example 2 – Solo dog feature (Salvador):**

     - Suggested allowing dogs to walk alone.
     - Affects product functionality → Action: **Consult product manager and operations team** before implementing.

   - **Example 3 – Single dog owners (Salvador):**

     - Asked how the app supports users with one dog.
     - User-centered and valuable → Action: **Create additional screens** for single-dog user flow.

   - **Example 4 – Button size and placement (Salvador):**

     - Concerned about inconsistency across screens.
     - Action: **Check Figma mockups** for consistent height, width, and alignment of buttons.

   - **Example 5 – Icon colors and labels (Shabi):**

     - Suggested simplifying icons and text labels.
     - Action: **Iterate on icon and label design** and **follow up for clarification** (color vs. text label).

   - **Example 6 – Button color accessibility (Shabi):**
     - Asked if orange CTA buttons meet accessibility standards.
     - Important for usability → Action: **Run color contrast checks**; change to a darker orange if necessary.

### Key Takeaways

- Not all feedback must be implemented — prioritize **useful, user-centered, or principle-based** feedback.
- Some feedback may **affect product scope** and require collaboration with other teams.
- Always verify **accessibility, consistency, and clarity** in your design updates.
- The process helps build **confidence, reflection skills, and professional judgment**.

   - Result: Simplifies the flow and **saves time** for users with only one dog.

2. **Ensure buttons are consistent in size**

   - Feedback: Some buttons appeared slightly inconsistent.
   - Update: Checked all buttons’ **height and width** in Figma.
   - Result: Found one inconsistent button and corrected it for uniformity.

3. **Review button placement**

   - Feedback: Possible misalignment of CTAs across screens.
   - Update: Verified button **x and y positions** using Figma’s right-side panel (e.g., x = 16, y = 8).
   - Result: Confirmed alignment across screens for consistent user flow.

4. **Iterate on top icons (progress tracker)**

   - Feedback: Icons and text labels appeared **too busy**.
   - Update: Removed circles and labels beneath icons.
   - Result: Achieved a **cleaner, more minimal** design.

5. **Check color contrast for accessibility**
   - Feedback: Ensure orange CTAs meet accessibility standards.
   - Update: Used **WebAIM contrast checker** to test against **WCAG guidelines**.
   - Result: Replaced the old orange with a **darker, AAA-accessible shade** (#D53E0B).
   - Also updated the **sticker sheet** to apply the new color globally to buttons, icons, review stars, and text.

### Pro Tip (Figma Efficiency)

- To change colors quickly:
  - **Select multiple elements** → Use **“Selection colors”** in the right panel → Edit the shared color style.
- Saves time and maintains **color consistency** across all components.

### Key Takeaways

- **Actionable feedback** leads to meaningful design improvements.
