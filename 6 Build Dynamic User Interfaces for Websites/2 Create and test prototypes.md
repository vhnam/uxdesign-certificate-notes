## Building Low-Fidelity Prototypes

### Overview

- Purpose: Test product ideas before creating the final product.
- Two prototype types:
  - **Low-fidelity prototypes**: Simple, interactive structures showing how a product looks and behaves.
  - **High-fidelity prototypes**: Polished designs closely matching the final product.

### Definitions

- **Low-fidelity prototype**: Basic version of a product used to communicate design concepts and test navigation and functionality.
- **High-fidelity prototype**: Detailed, realistic model used for final testing before production.
- **Wireframe**: Blueprint of a product’s structure, without interactivity.

### Key Differences

- **Wireframe vs. Low-fidelity prototype**:
  - Wireframe: Static structure showing layout.
  - Low-fidelity prototype: Connects wireframes with functionality and navigation for testing.

### Process of Building Low-Fidelity Prototypes

1. **Create wireframes**: Outline the structure of the product.
2. **Build the prototype**: Add interactivity to wireframes.
3. **Test with users**: Observe how users navigate and complete tasks.
4. **Collect feedback**: Identify and fix usability issues before moving to high-fidelity design.

### Purpose of Testing

- Identify functional issues.
- Validate user navigation paths.
- Gather insights for design improvement before finalizing visuals.

## Wireframes vs. Mock-ups

### Overview

- Focus: Understanding key differences between **wireframes** and **mock-ups**.
- Importance: Mock-ups bring visual life to wireframes and help visualize the final product.

### Definitions

- **Wireframe**:

  - Outline or sketch of a product or screen.
  - Defines structure, layout, and hierarchy.
  - Can be drawn on paper (for quick brainstorming) or digitally (for refined layouts).

- **Mock-up**:
  - Static, **high-fidelity** representation of a final product.
  - Includes **visual and UI elements** like color, typography, and icons.
  - Not clickable or interactive — ideal for making visual refinements.

### Key Differences

| Feature           | Wireframe                           | Mock-up                             |
| ----------------- | ----------------------------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| **Purpose**       | Define structure and layout         | Visualize final design              |
| **Fidelity**      | Low                                 | High                                |
| **Interactivity** | None                                | None (static visual)                |
| **Content**       | Simplified (no detail or color)     | Detailed (color, typography, icons) |
| **Use Case**      | Brainstorming and structure testing | Visual refinement and presentation  |

### Example: Dog Walker App

- **Wireframe (Left)**: Shows page layout and content hierarchy in grayscale.
- **Mock-up (Right)**: Adds colors, fonts, and icons to represent the final UI and help visualize user flow.

### Design Guidance

- Transitioning from wireframe to mock-up:
  - Not a **paint-by-number** process — adjustments are encouraged.
  - Designers may rearrange elements for **better aesthetics**, **usability**, or **accessibility**.
- Like wireframes, mock-ups go through **multiple iterations** with feedback in between.

## Feedback

This is mostly a repeat of a previous module, it sounds like this course is also available as a standalone... Some of it is literally IDENTICAL, with my quizzes etc being already answered.

Previous hosts also come back!?
