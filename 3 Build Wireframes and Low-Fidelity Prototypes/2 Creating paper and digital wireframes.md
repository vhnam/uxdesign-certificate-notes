## Information architecture (IA)

Organizes content to help users understand where they are in a product, and where the information they want is... AKA users can find what they want, quickly and intuitively.

Information architecture should be informed by many sources, like user research and the ways that existing products in the market are structured. Knowing the users, their goals, and their behaviors is key to effective IA. IA helps organize a site or an app; it's like a map.

Why is it important?

- Organizes & defines overall structure
- Provides high level view of product
- Helps stakeholders review designs
- Helps engineers understand how to organize the data
- Allows ideas to grow and iterate with the design

Information architecture is made up of three pieces:

- **Organization:** The organization is how different pieces of information connect in a product.
- **Hierarchy:** The hierarchy is often called the “tree structure” and is where a larger category is placed at the top and specific categories related to the overall category are placed underneath. Peer information is placed side by side (or on the same level as each other).
- **Sequence:** The sequence enables users to move through an app via certain orders or steps.

## 8 principles of IA

Verbatim:

1. Object principle: You should view your content as “living” and as something that changes and grows over time.
2. Choice principle: People think they want to have many choices, but they actually need fewer choices that are well-organized.
3. Disclosure principle: Information should not be unexpected or unnecessary.
4. Exemplar principle: Humans put things into categories and group different concepts together.
5. Front door principle: The home web page doesn't need to do everything. Users often get to your site through a side entrance.
6. Multiple classification principle: People have different ways of searching for information.
7. Focused navigation principle: There must be a strategy and logic behind the way navigation menus are designed.
8. Growth principle: The amount of content in a design will grow over time.

Because mobile screens are generally smaller, the challenges that come with creating information architecture for a mobile app are to

1. consider ways to focus on the essential content and eliminate or move around less important content
2. consider the size and spacing of any touchscreen targets
3. consider ways to make sure the mobile text will be large enough.

Good information architecture is one of the first steps in setting up a design layout that encourages the easiest paths for users to navigate through the content, so be sure to keep these points in mind as you continue to build mobile apps.

## Paper Wireframes

Wireframe is a basic outline of a digital experience, like an app or website, that's made up of lines and simple shapes.

Purpose:

- Establish the basic structure of a page
- Highlight the intended function of the product
- Save time and resources

Benefits:

- Fast
- Inexpensive
- Explore lots of ideas
- Identify the content to include in their products
- Catch problems early
- Get stakeholders to focus on structure
- Save time and effort
- Iterate quickly

### Moving from paper to to digital wireframes

- Is my paper wireframe complete?
- Have I receive feedback on my paper wireframe

### Transitioning to digital wireframes

- Use actual content for important pieces of text
- Hold back on adding experience content

## Digital wireframes

Benefits:

- Allow you to pay more attention to the details
- Easier to share

## Gestalt principles

Gestalt principles describe how humans group similar elements, recognize patterns, and simplify complex images when we perceive objects

- Similarity: Elements that look similar have perceived similar functionality.
- Common region: Elements in the same areas are perceived to be grouped together
- Proximity: Things that are close together appear to be more related than things that are spaced farther apart.
