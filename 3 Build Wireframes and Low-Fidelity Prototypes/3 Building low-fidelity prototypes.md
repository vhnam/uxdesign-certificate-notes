## Prototype

A prototype is an early model of a product that demonstrates its functionality, without actually building the entire product. A prototype shows stakeholders and your potential users what your design idea can do.

A low-fidelity prototype is a simple interactive model that provides a basic idea of what the product would look like. The goal is to make your designs testable so that you can collect and analyze feedback early on

For a paper low-fidelity prototype. interactivity might be a human acting as a computer and manually changing the design in real time.

For a digital low-fidelity prototype, interactivity might be connected wireframes where you can click on a certain part of the wireframe, like a submit button, and be taken to the next wireframe.

## Paper prototypes

Benefits:

- Inexpensive
- Rapid iteration
- Low commitment
- Encourage honest feedback, as less polished
- Collaborative activity

Drawbacks:

- Can be hard to interpret
- Only be tested in person
- Difficult with remote team

## Bias recap

Biases are unreasonable and unfair distortions of judgment in favor of or against a person or thing. Biases may be favorable or unfavorable: bias in favor of or against an idea. Other words for bias may include predisposition, preconception, predilection, and partiality.

### Cognitive bias in UX design

In UX design, the concept of bias is focused on the term cognitive biases. According to the Interaction Design Foundation, a cognitive bias is a systematic (non random) way in which the context affects judgment and decision-making. In other words, it's all about the framing of information.

### Verbatim:

Ambiguity effect bias: The tendency to choose options for which the probability of a certain outcome is known, while avoiding options for which the outcome is ambiguous or uncertain.

Clustering illusion bias: The tendency to find false patterns and trends in random information when no such patterns exist.

Confirmation bias: The tendency to interpret data in a way that supports your preexisting beliefs.

Cultural bias: The tendency to interpret words or behaviors according to one’s own cultural norms, instead of considering the words and behaviors within the context of the participants’ own culture.

False-consensus bias: The tendency to see your own opinions and behaviors as being common, while viewing other opinions and behaviors as being uncommon.

Framing bias: The tendency to make decisions based on how the information is presented or "framed" instead of the information itself.

Fundamental attribution bias: The tendency to attribute someone's behavior to their character or personality, while downplaying the influence of situational and environmental factors.

Hindsight bias: The tendency to believe that past events were more easily predictable than they were.

Implicit bias: This is a collection of attitudes and stereotypes we associate with people without our conscious knowledge.

Racial bias: The tendency to believe that people of a specific racial group have distinctive characteristics and behaviors, generally leading to negative emotional reactions and discrimination.

Serial position bias: The tendency to remember the first and last items in a list better than those in the middle.

Social desirability bias: The tendency to answer questions in a way that will make you look good to others.

Sunk-cost bias: The tendency to continue a behavior if you've already invested time, effort, and money into it, even if the current costs outweigh the benefits.

Survivorship bias: The tendency to focus on successful cases while overlooking the failed ones.

Transparency bias: The tendency to overestimate how well other people understand your own internal thoughts and feelings, or to overestimate how well you understand other people's thoughts and feelings.

### How to identify and limit bias in UX design

- Learn about the different types of bias: Know what biases exist in order to recognize and mitigate them. You can reference some of them in this reading.
- Practice self-awareness to identify your own biases: Employ a strategy for developing awareness by practicing reflexivity, introspection, mindfulness, and perspective-taking.
- Learn to spot bias in others: Learn to recognize it in your teammates and stakeholders—and don’t be afraid to call it out when it comes up.
- Be responsive: View each design idea as a hypothesis. Be willing to change direction in response to research findings.
- Prioritize impact over output: Conduct a pre-mortem project. This is a loss aversion technique that encourages us to brainstorm potential oversights and identify preventive measures early in our processes.

## Deceptive patterns (aka Dark Patterns)

Deceptive patterns are ethically wrong and not a good business practice.

- Forced continuity: The practice of charging a user for a membership without a warning or a reminder.
- Sneak into basket: Items added by default. or When a user has to remove an item from their cart if they don’t want to buy it, which is an extra step that could be easily missed.
- Hidden costs: Hidden or unexpected charges in the user’s cart that are not revealed until the end of the checkout process.
- Confirmshaming: Made to feel guilty when opting out.
- Urgency: Limited time sales etc.
- Scarcity: Showing how many are left / in carts.

Deceptive patterns are harder to ignore than traditional advertising because they are embedded directly within the user experience and decision-making process. Unlike ads that users can easily skip or avoid, deceptive patterns manipulate user behavior during interactions—like suggesting items right when you're about to buy—making them more subtle, persistent, and harder to consciously resist. This close integration increases their influence and effectiveness.

Deceptive patterns are harder to ignore than traditional forms of advertising because they're designed to be difficult to identify.

`Good UX benefits both the user and the business, not one or the other.`

## Attention economy

The attention economy refers to the idea that human attention is limited, as noted by Herbert A. Simon. Since people struggle with multitasking, technology should support rather than distract them. UX designers must be mindful of how their designs influence behavior, avoiding features that foster addiction or harm users' well-being. Poorly designed technology can lead to issues like anxiety, depression, or FOMO, especially when users are overwhelmed by notifications or social media stimuli. Ultimately, designers should create experiences that enhance users' lives, not detract from them.

Here are some best practices for you to consider to help you avoid bad design decisions:

- Avoid deceptive patterns. Be honest with users. Think about your purpose for design and how your own values align with the design.
- Think about goals and metrics. Understand your company’s business goals and key performance indicators. Pay attention to how these business goals might contradict or align with your users’ goals.
- Share good design practices with the people you work with. Understand your position of power as a UX designer. You have the ability to influence the decision-making process for good and make sure that the right design choices are being made.

The idea of attention economy has become increasingly important to the discussion of how design can positively and negatively affect users. The more we respect users’ time, attention, and experiences, the easier it will be to keep the focus of design on people, their needs, and the ways they can enjoy technology.

## Ethical design

Ethical design is about understanding how your design work affects the world.

As a UX designer, you have a responsibility to approach your work ethically and to keep the user’s best interest in mind. The products you design will be a part of the users’ lives, but they should not:

- Consume or control the user.
- Promote addictive behaviors.
- Promote unhealthy relationships between the user and a device or an app.
- Take advantage of the user.

Instead, the products you design should give users a choice about the actions they do want to take while using your product. Remember, apps should engage users, but apps should also be honest about their intentions and goals.

### Dominant culture

As a UX designer, it's essential to consider the needs of all users, not just those from dominant or privileged groups. Dominant cultures can shape design norms, potentially excluding diverse perspectives. To create inclusive products, designers must prioritize user needs by researching with a wide range of people, challenging their own assumptions, and reflecting on different user experiences. Asking questions about how users differ from oneself and how to include non-dominant groups helps ensure the design is accessible and relevant to everyone.

### Marginalized and underrepresented populations

When designing products, it's important to consider marginalized and underrepresented populations—groups often excluded due to discrimination, limited access, or cultural invisibility.

- **Marginalized populations** are people who experience discrimination or exclusion from mainstream society because of characteristics or life experiences that are wrongfully seen as inferior. This can include people with disabilities, those with limited access to technology, or individuals who speak different languages.
- **Underrepresented populations** are groups whose values, identities, and experiences are not commonly reflected in a society shaped by dominant culture. Examples include people of color, ethnic minorities, and individuals of certain genders or sexual orientations.

Designers must recognize how their own backgrounds and assumptions can influence design decisions and potentially exclude these users. By intentionally including diverse perspectives and not defaulting to dominant cultural norms, designers can create more inclusive and accessible products that serve all users equitably.

### Edge cases

Edge cases are unexpected user situations that designers didn’t plan for and users can’t fix on their own. Good UX design anticipates these cases and helps guide users back to a smooth experience, or "happy path." Designers should approach edge cases thoughtfully, as they can reveal bias or gaps in inclusivity. It's important to stay flexible and adjust designs to support all users, including those in less common or overlooked scenarios.

### Inclusive design

Inclusive design involves making design decisions that consider diverse personal identifiers like ability, race, economic status, language, age, and gender. It emphasizes building products that are accessible to the widest range of users. A key part of this approach is having a diverse design team—including people from traditionally excluded groups—to bring in varied perspectives throughout the design process.

The core idea is that there’s no “average” user; no one should be left out simply because their needs weren’t considered. Inclusive design aims to ensure everyone can use and benefit from a product.

### Accountability

To create inclusive designs, it's important to be accountable to your coworkers, stakeholders, and users—especially those with different backgrounds and perspectives. Actively seek their input and use their insights to improve your designs, ensuring they reflect a wider range of experiences and needs.

### Design ethically

To practice ethical design, consider the following key actions:

- Create inclusive personas by intentionally including marginalized and underrepresented users. Use demographic factors like age, gender, and ability, but be ready to revise personas when their limitations appear.
- Broaden your definition of “stakeholder” to include anyone affected by the project—not just decision-makers. This helps ensure you're designing for a wider, more diverse audience.
- Increase collaboration by involving people with different perspectives throughout the design process. This leads to better insights and more inclusive products.
- Think beyond universal design and aim for multiversal design, which offers multiple ways for different users to access and experience a product equally—ensuring no one is excluded, regardless of ability or background.

### You can make a difference

While there's still progress to be made in ethical and inclusive UX design, learning these principles now positions you to make a meaningful impact. As a designer, you can help push the industry forward by staying accountable, being inclusive, and recognizing the influence your work has on others. Equity-focused design is a continuous journey—it requires ongoing learning and growth to create meaningful experiences for all users.

## The importance of equitable design

Equitable and inclusive design is crucial for creating accessible experiences for people from all backgrounds, including those just coming online ("the next billion users"). Teams focus on ensuring diverse user participation and customizing products like Search and YouTube to accommodate different languages, locations, and levels of digital literacy. Directly engaging with users helps build empathy and a deeper understanding of their experiences, leading to more meaningful and effective design solutions that truly serve everyone.
