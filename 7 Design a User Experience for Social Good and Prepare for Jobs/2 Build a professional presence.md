## Preparing for Whiteboard and Take-Home UX Design Interviews

### Overview

- **Whiteboard interviews** are practical exercises where you solve a design problem in real time while interviewers observe your process.
- The goal is to assess your **problem-solving**, **collaboration**, **communication**, and **design thinking** under pressure.
- These interviews simulate real-world design situations and teamwork.
- A related format, the **take-home design exercise**, follows a similar process but gives you more time to complete your work independently.

### What Happens During a Whiteboard Interview

- You’re given a **design prompt** to solve on a whiteboard (physical or digital).
- Interviewers may:
  - Ask questions as you work.
  - Join in on the whiteboard to collaborate.
- The session tests:
  - How you approach ambiguity.
  - Your ability to communicate design decisions clearly.
  - How you collaborate under real-world conditions.

### How to Prepare for a Whiteboard Interview

1. **Research the Format**

   - Review example questions on sites like _Indeed_ and _Glassdoor_.
   - Practice with design prompt generators (like **Sharpen**).
   - Understand that prompts are **broad but focused** — they should let you show creativity and reasoning within time constraints.

2. **Practice Thinking Aloud**

   - Explain your **thought process** and **decisions** as you design.
   - Aim for clear, structured communication without overexplaining.
   - Record yourself practicing and review for clarity.

3. **Clarify the Task**

   - Repeat the prompt back to the interviewer to confirm understanding.
   - Ask questions about:
     - The **user** (most important).
     - **Goals**, **constraints**, and **use cases**.
     - **Edge cases** or demographic context.
   - Clarify ambiguities early — they’re often intentional to test your adaptability.

4. **Work Through Your Design Process**

   - Use your preferred approach — typically:
     - Empathize → Define → Ideate → Prototype → Test.
   - It’s okay to **skip or reorder steps** based on the scenario.
   - Focus on reasoning and prioritization, not perfection.

5. **Show Confidence**
   - You’ve already impressed the employer by reaching this stage.
   - Treat the exercise as a chance to **demonstrate creativity and collaboration**.
   - Remember: Interviewers want to see _how_ you think, not a flawless solution.

### What Interviewers Evaluate

Interviewers commonly ask themselves:

- Did the candidate ask smart, clarifying questions?
- Do they understand the **user** and **problem**?
- Does their design fit within **constraints**?
- Are they **collaborative** or overly independent?
- Do they explore multiple ideas or stick to one?
- Are they addressing the **core problem** effectively?
- How well do they **communicate** and **present** their thinking?
- Would this person work well on a team?

### Take-Home Design Exercises

- Similar to whiteboard interviews but done **independently**, often within **12–72 hours**.
- You’ll be given a **prompt** and asked to:
  - Research the problem.
  - Develop design ideas.
  - Present your **solution and rationale**.
- **Read instructions carefully** and clarify anything unclear before starting.
- Typically, you’ll **present your finished work** in a later interview round or panel.

### Key Takeaways

- Whiteboard and take-home exercises test both your **design process** and **communication skills**.
- **Preparation tips:**
  - Research common prompts.
  - Practice thinking aloud and explaining your design logic.
  - Clarify the task and ask questions early.
  - Stay confident and adaptable under pressure.
- Ultimately, these exercises mirror real UX teamwork — they show how you approach **problems, collaboration, and iteration** in practice.

## Best Practices for Whiteboard UX Design Interviews

### Overview

- Reaching the **whiteboard interview** stage is a major milestone — it means the employer is interested in your **skills, thought process, and communication**.
- This stage involves solving a **design problem in real time** on a whiteboard, either one-on-one or with a panel.
- The goal is to observe **how you think, collaborate, and handle ambiguity** — not to produce a perfect design.

### Key Best Practices

#### 1. Do Your Research

- Review **whiteboard interview examples** and practice prompts beforehand.
- Recommended readings from _UX Collective_:
  - _5 Steps to Master a Whiteboard Design Challenge_
  - _A New Designer’s Experience with the Google Whiteboard Interview_
- Expect limited time — focus on **clarity and process**, not polish.
- The purpose is to **demonstrate your UX thinking**, not to deliver a final product.

#### 2. Practice Thinking Aloud

- Explain your decisions and reasoning as you work.
- Record yourself practicing with example prompts to ensure your explanations are logical and concise.
- Clear communication helps interviewers understand how you approach design challenges.

#### 3. Clarify Your Task

- Questions are intentionally vague to test your ability to handle **ambiguity**.
- Always:
  - **Repeat the task** back to the interviewer.
  - **Ask clarifying questions** about goals, users, or constraints.
  - Ensure you understand what success looks like before you start designing.

#### 4. Show Your Process

- Begin with the **user** and their **pain points**.
- Demonstrate a structured approach — you can refer to the UX process (Empathize → Define → Ideate → Prototype → Test), but you don’t need to follow every step in full detail.
- Three ways to show your process:
  1. Create a **framework** — structure your thoughts visually.
  2. Demonstrate **teamwork** — show how you collaborate.
  3. Clarify **assumptions** — explain what you’re assuming and why.

#### 5. Demonstrate Teamwork

- Treat interviewers like collaborators — engage them as if you were on the same design team.
- Invite feedback, acknowledge others’ ideas, and build upon them.
- Showing that you’re **open, respectful, and team-oriented** is a strong advantage.

#### 6. Ask Questions

- Continue asking relevant questions throughout the exercise.
- Examples:
  - “Who exactly is the user?”
  - “What are the key use cases or edge cases?”
  - “What constraints should I be aware of?”
- Questions show curiosity and thoughtful problem-solving.

#### 7. Be Confident

- Trust the **UX design process** you’ve learned: empathize, define, ideate, prototype, test.
- Stay calm, focused, and confident in your abilities.
- Remember: You’ve made it this far because the company already sees your potential.

## Introduction to Freelancing for UX Designers

## How to Find and Prepare for Freelance Clients as a UX Designer

Starting a freelance UX career is an exciting step — but before searching for clients, you’ll need to make sure your business is prepared, professional, and visible. Once that foundation is set, you can begin finding and pitching clients both locally and online.

### 🧱 Step 1: Prepare Your Business for Clients

#### 1. **Create an Up-to-Date Portfolio Website**

- Your portfolio is your most powerful marketing tool.
- Keep it current with:
  - **Recent design projects and case studies.**
  - Clear examples of your **design process** and **impact.**
- Everything connected to your name online should reflect your **latest skills, style, and growth** as a designer.

#### 2. **Develop an Online Presence**

- Create **professional social media pages** (LinkedIn, Instagram, etc.) for your freelance business.
  - Include a link to your portfolio.
  - Describe who you are and the UX services you offer.
  - Post examples of your work regularly.
- Use **trending hashtags** and topics related to UX to improve visibility.
- Link posts across platforms and ask your network to **share** your content to increase reach.
- Build **meaningful connections** — engage with comments and discussions to grow your reputation.

#### 3. **Leverage Your Personal Network**

- Share your new business with family, friends, and professional connections.
- Example post:
  > “I’ve just finished another UX project! I’m excited to keep growing my freelance design business. If you or someone you know needs help improving their digital experience, let’s connect.”
- Stay active — post regularly to keep your network aware of your work.
- You can also **personally reach out** to people who might need help.  
  Example:
  > “Hey! I noticed your website’s mobile version could be improved. I’d love to help make it more user-friendly.”

**Pro tip:** Offer a **small referral bonus** to anyone who connects you with a paying client.

### 🏙 Step 2: Connect with Your Local Community

- Once you’ve established an online foundation, **reach out to local businesses** that could use UX help.  
  Examples:
  - Redesign a local restaurant’s outdated website for online ordering.
  - Build an event-tracking app for a nearby café or venue.
- Create **custom pitch templates** that include:
  - Who you are and what your business offers.
  - Why your design services will help their business.
  - Your rate or proposal for work.
- Each pitch should be **personalized** and aligned with your business plan and target audience.
- Remember: **Pitching takes time.** Start small — one or two businesses at a time — and refine your process as you go.

### 🌐 Step 3: Build Your Online Client Network

In addition to local work, explore **online platforms** where freelancers and clients connect:

| Platform | Description |
| - | |

These platforms can help you **gain exposure**, **build credibility**, and **secure consistent projects**, though they typically charge service fees.

### 💬 Step 4: Offer Pro Bono (Free) Work — Strategically

- Consider doing **pro bono work** (free projects) for:
  - **Nonprofits** or charitable organizations.
  - Causes you care about or industries you want to explore.
- Benefits:
  - Builds your **portfolio** with meaningful projects.
  - Provides **networking opportunities** and **referrals**.
  - Expands your **real-world experience** as a designer.

⚠️ **Important: Set Clear Boundaries**

- Define and agree on the **scope of work** in writing.
- Avoid **scope creep** — when projects expand beyond the original plan.
- If the scope changes, create a **new agreement** with rates for additional work.

**Helpful pro bono platforms:**

- [**Catchafire**](https://www.catchafire.org): Matches professionals with nonprofits in need of specific skills.
- [**VolunteerMatch**](https://www.volunteermatch.org): Connects volunteers with nonprofit organizations seeking design help.

### 🧭 Step 5: Choose Your Freelance Path

There are multiple ways to structure your freelance career:

1. **Work Solo**

   - Maximum freedom, but full responsibility for every aspect of your business.

2. **Partner with a Developer**

   - Collaborate on design + technical projects.
   - Share decisions, clients, and creative ideas.

3. **Join a Freelance Marketplace**
   - Platforms like **Fiverr** or **Toptal** handle client connections and payments.
   - You maintain creative control but pay platform fees.

No matter the path, an updated **portfolio** and **consistent online presence** are essential for success.

### 💡 Step 6: Maintain and Grow Your Freelance Business

To sustain success, treat your freelance practice like a long-term business.

#### Ongoing Best Practices:

    - [NOLO](https://www.nolo.com)
    - [LegalZoom](https://www.legalzoom.com)
    - [Web Design Law](https://www.webdesignlaw.com)
  - For complex projects, consider hiring a **contract lawyer**.

Once both parties agree, **sign the contract** and send your **invoice** for the initial payment.

### 6. Start the Project

After receiving your first payment:

- Begin working according to the **SOW timeline**.
- Communicate regularly with your client about progress and feedback.
- Meet your deadlines and deliver high-quality work.

### 7. Build Long-Term Relationships

Your **first client** is more than just a project — it’s a stepping stone to growth.

- Satisfied clients can:
  - **Refer new clients** through word-of-mouth.
  - **Promote your work** on social media.
  - **Return for future projects.**

Delivering a great experience builds your **reputation** and credibility as a professional UX freelancer.
