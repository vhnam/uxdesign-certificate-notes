- **Purpose:** Demonstrates how UX professionals can use AI to work smarter, faster, and more creatively.

## The T-C-R-E-I Framework for Writing Effective Prompts

> **Mnemonic:** _Thoughtfully Create Really Excellent Inputs_

### 1. Task

- Define **what you want the AI to do** clearly and specifically.
- Include:
  - **Persona:** The role or expertise you want the AI to assume (e.g., “marketing executive with 15 years of experience”).
  - **Format:** Desired output structure (e.g., bullet list, table, summary).

### 2. Context

- Provide essential background information so AI understands your intent.
- Example:
  - Vague: “Give me ideas for a birthday present under $30.”
  - Better: “Give me 5 ideas for a $30 gift for a 29-year-old who loves skiing.”

### 3. References

- Include examples or data the AI can draw from to improve relevance.
- Use past examples or related material when available.
- Note: Not all prompts require references, especially for creative or exploratory tasks.

### 4. Evaluate

- Review the AI’s output to check if it meets your needs.
- Reflect on whether your input was clear or detailed enough.

### 5. Iterate

- Refine and retry by adjusting your prompt.
- Iteration helps improve accuracy and usefulness of results.
- The **order** of steps is flexible — substance matters more than sequence.

## Responsible Use of Generative AI

### Human-in-the-Loop Principle

- Combine **AI efficiency** with **human judgment**:
  - Humans train, verify, and refine AI outputs.
  - AI complements—never replaces—human expertise.

### Data Responsibility

- Be cautious with **confidential or sensitive information**:
  - Follow company data-use policies.
  - Avoid entering personal data, even in personal projects.
  - Check how AI tools handle and store your inputs.

> for a cross-functional audience:  
> ‘Iterative affinity mapping facilitated the identification of key personas  
> to inform the creation of low-fidelity wireframes for heuristic evaluation.’”

- **AI Output:** Provides several simplified options to improve clarity.
- **Application:** Useful for rewriting proposals, presentations, documents, or emails.

### Applying the T-C-R-E-I Framework

#### E — Evaluate

- Review the AI’s output:
  - Does it meet your expectations?
  - Is it clear and accurate for your audience?

#### I — Iterate

- Refine your prompt if results are off:
  - Add **more specific instructions** or **context**.
  - Include **references or examples** of what you expected (R = References).
  - Adjust **tone or phrasing** for clarity.

##### Iteration Tips

1. **Be specific:** More details = more accurate output.
2. **Use examples:** Show the AI what kind of result you want.
3. **Check phrasing:** Break long sentences into simpler ones.
4. **Refine based on what you liked/disliked:**
