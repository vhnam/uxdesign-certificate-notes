## Tailoring Your Resume for Each Job

### Why Resume Tailoring Matters

- Resume as a marketing tool: Your resume is often the first impression and must convince employers you are right for _this specific role_.
- One-size-fits-all resumes: Ineffective because different roles—even with the same title—require different skills.
- Recruiter behavior:

  - 83% of recruiters prefer candidates who tailor resumes.
  - Recruiters spend ~7.4 seconds reviewing each resume.

### Understanding Role-Specific Needs

- Same job title, different expectations:

  - Large companies: May value research depth and complex systems experience.
  - Startups: May prioritize rapid execution, prototyping, and experimentation.

- Key takeaway: Always align your resume with the job description, not just the title.

### Resume Content: What Makes It Stand Out

#### Demonstrate Measurable Results

- Quantification: Use numbers and outcomes to prove impact.
- Example:

  - Instead of: “Increased sales”
  - Use: “Increased sales of a new product by 30% by closing eight new accounts in under three months”

#### Highlight Transferable Skills

- Transferable skills: Skills gained from past roles that apply to new jobs.
- Example:

  - Store clerk → communication, customer service, problem-solving
  - Connect skills directly to outcomes (e.g., increased customer reviews).

#### Use Impactful Language

- Action-oriented writing:

  - Use strong verbs and precise terms.

- Example transformation:

  - Before: “Made a new company dashboard”
  - After: “Designed and built a real-time interactive dashboard enabling faster decision-making for five teams”

#### Add Specific Context

- Avoid vague traits like “team player.”
- Provide concrete examples:

  - Mentoring teammates
  - Solving specific technical problems

### Resume Structure: How It Should Look

#### Keep It Concise

- Length guidelines:

  - Ideally one page
  - Maximum two pages

- Rationale:

  - Easier for recruiters to scan
  - Signals clarity and prioritization

#### Make It Scannable

- Formatting techniques:

  - Bullet points
  - Clear section titles
  - Bold or italic text for emphasis

- Logical order:

  - Highlight key skills prominently
  - Use layout to guide the reader’s eye

#### Optimize for Keywords

- Keywords: Important terms and phrases from the job description.
- Purpose:

  - Helps recruiters quickly identify fit
  - Improves alignment with role requirements

### Personalization: Fine-Tuning for Each Role

- Keyword alignment:

  - Incorporate relevant words like “quick-thinking” or “leader” when appropriate.

- Selective inclusion:

  - Emphasize experiences that match the role.
  - Remove or shorten less relevant experiences.

- Goal:

  - Show a clear, direct connection between your background and the job’s responsibilities.

### Core Principle

- A strong resume is:

  - Tailored
  - Results-driven
  - Concise
  - Easy to scan
  - Clearly aligned with the specific job description
